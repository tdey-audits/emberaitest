## Files Modified

### Configuration Updates (2 modified)
1. `typescript/compose.yml` - Added healthchecks to all services:
   - lending-agent-no-wallet
   - swapping-agent-no-wallet
   - coingecko-mcp-server
   - defisafety-agent
   - web app
   - database

2. `typescript/package.json` - Added deployment convenience scripts:
   - `pnpm deploy:dev` - Development deployment
   - `pnpm deploy:paper` - Paper trading with validation
   - `pnpm deploy:prod` - Production with validation
   - `pnpm validate:env` - Environment validation

### Documentation Updates (1 modified)
3. `README.md` - Added comprehensive deployment section with:
   - Environment overview
   - Quick deploy commands
   - Links to detailed guides

## Key Features

### Environment Validation
- Comprehensive validation script checking all required variables
- Detects placeholder values that need updating
- Environment-specific checks (dev/paper-trading/production)
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance

### Multi-Environment Support
- **Development**: Hot reloading, debug logging, source mounting
- **Paper Trading**: Production builds, testnet configs, resource limits
- **Production**: Optimized builds, security hardening, healthchecks

### Healthcheck Implementation
All services now include Docker healthchecks:
- HTTP endpoint checks using Node.js fetch API
- Configurable intervals (30s), timeouts (10s), retries (3)
- Appropriate start periods (40s for agents, 60s for web)
- Database healthcheck using pg_isready

### Comprehensive Documentation
- Complete deployment guide covering end-to-end setup
- CI/CD integration guide for new agents
- Platform-specific guides for major cloud providers
- Emergency procedures for common issues
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Developer Experience
- Simple deployment commands (`pnpm deploy:dev/paper/prod`)
- Environment validation before deployment
- Clear documentation with examples
- Platform flexibility (Docker, Railway, Heroku, etc.)

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Environment validation script executes correctly
2. ✅ Detects missing required variables
3. ✅ Identifies placeholder values
4. ✅ Provides environment-specific checks
5. ✅ Docker Compose files have correct YAML syntax
6. ✅ Package.json scripts are properly defined
7. ✅ All documentation files are properly formatted

## Usage Examples

### Validate Environment
```bash
cd typescript
pnpm validate:env
```

### Deploy to Development
```bash
cd typescript
pnpm deploy:dev
```

### Deploy to Paper Trading
```bash
cd typescript
pnpm deploy:paper
```

### Deploy to Production
```bash
cd typescript
pnpm deploy:prod
```

### Check Service Health
```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f
```

## Breaking Changes

None - All changes are additive and backward compatible.

## Migration Guide

No migration needed. Existing deployments continue to work as before.
New features are opt-in through new compose files and scripts.
