# Troubleshooting: Finalize Deployment, Configuration, and Operational Documentation

Branch: finalize-deployment-configs-docs-ci | Updated: 2025-10-22

## Current Focus

Working on: Finalizing deployment configs and operational documentation
Approach: Create multi-environment Docker configs, validation scripts, and comprehensive docs

## Evidence Collected

- Current state has only compose.yml for production
- Only ember-agent has healthcheck (Dockerfile.prod)
- CI workflow exists but needs to be documented for new agents
- .env.example exists with good examples
- No Procfiles exist
- No environment validation script exists
- No dedicated deployment documentation

## Assumptions

- Need separate configs for dev, paper trading, and production
- Healthchecks should follow Node.js HTTP patterns
- Environment validation should check critical API keys and configs
- Documentation should cover full lifecycle from setup to emergency procedures

## Attempts Log

Starting implementation...

## Discovered Patterns

- Agents run on different ports (3001, 3005, 3007, 3010, etc.)
- All agents follow similar Dockerfile patterns
- Services use env_file with cascading configs (root .env + agent-specific .env)
- Web app depends on PostgreSQL database

## Tasks to Complete

1. ✅ Create environment validation script (scripts/validate-env.sh)
2. ✅ Create compose.dev.yaml for development
3. ✅ Create compose.paper-trading.yaml for paper trading
4. ✅ Update compose.yml with healthchecks
5. ✅ Create comprehensive deployment documentation (docs/deployment-guide.md)
6. ✅ Document CI pipeline setup for new agents (docs/ci-cd-setup.md)
7. ✅ Add emergency procedures documentation (in deployment-guide.md)
8. ✅ Add deployment scripts to package.json
9. ✅ Create Procfile for Heroku/Railway
10. ✅ Create railway.toml configuration
11. ✅ Create deployment platforms guide (docs/deployment-platforms.md)
12. ✅ Update README.md with deployment section

## Resolution

### What Was Completed

1. **Environment Validation Script**: Created comprehensive validation script that checks:
   - Required environment variables
   - Placeholder values
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - AI provider API keys (at least one required)
   - Database and blockchain configuration

2. **Docker Compose Configurations**:
   - `compose.dev.yaml`: Development with hot reloading, debug logging, volume mounts
   - `compose.paper-trading.yaml`: Paper trading with testnet configs, resource limits
   - `compose.yml`: Updated production config with healthchecks for all services

3. **Healthchecks**: Added to all services using Node.js fetch API:
   - 30-second intervals
   - 10-second timeouts
   - 3 retries before marking unhealthy
   - Appropriate start periods (40s for agents, 60s for web)

4. **Documentation**:
   - **deployment-guide.md**: 500+ line comprehensive guide covering:
     - Prerequisites and environment setup
     - Development, paper trading, and production deployment
     - Healthchecks and monitoring
     - Emergency procedures
     - Backup and recovery
     - Troubleshooting
   
   - **ci-cd-setup.md**: Complete CI/CD guide covering:
     - GitHub Actions workflow overview
     - Adding CI tests for new agents
     - Required secrets management
     - Local CI testing
     - Troubleshooting CI issues
   
   - **deployment-platforms.md**: Platform-specific guides for:
     - Docker Compose (recommended)
     - Railway
     - Heroku
     - AWS ECS
     - Google Cloud Run
     - DigitalOcean App Platform
     - Self-hosted VPS

5. **Deployment Scripts**: Added to package.json:
   - `pnpm deploy:dev`: Development deployment
   - `pnpm deploy:paper`: Paper trading deployment with validation
   - `pnpm deploy:prod`: Production deployment with validation
   - `pnpm validate:env`: Environment validation

6. **Platform Configurations**:
   - **Procfile**: For Heroku and Railway deployment
   - **railway.toml**: For Railway-specific configuration

7. **README Updates**: Added deployment section with quick reference

### Key Features

- Environment validation before deployment
- Multi-environment support (dev/paper-trading/production)
- Comprehensive healthchecks for all services
- Emergency procedures for common issues
- Platform-specific deployment guides
- CI/CD integration documentation
