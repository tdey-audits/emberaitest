# Troubleshooting: Replay Engine & Backtesting Framework

Branch: feat-replay-engine-paper-trading-backtest | Updated: 2025-10-22T20:31:50Z

## Current Focus

Working on: Understand existing codebase and requirements for replay engine/backtesting
Approach: Initial discovery and planning

## Evidence Collected

- Repository contains TypeScript monorepo under /typescript
- Project includes papery trading compose config

## Assumptions

- Replay engine will live within existing agent framework
- Tests will be added under /test directory following Vitest structure

## Attempts Log

2025-10-22T20:31:50Z Note: Reviewed repository structure and agent-node package. Planning implementation approach for replay engine and backtesting CLI.

## Current Focus

Working on: Plan architecture for replay engine & backtesting framework
Approach: Add dedicated paper-trading module under agent-node with CLI integration and tests.

2025-10-22T21:05:32Z Attempt 2: Implemented paper-trading module (types, dataset loader, replay engine, metrics, backtest engine) and basic CLI command structure.

## Evidence Collected
- Added fixture dataset at tests/fixtures/paper-trading/simple-gmx-market.json
- Created GmxReplayEngine with deterministic equity tracking
- Added BacktestEngine to orchestrate strategies over datasets
- Introduced CLI backtest command with builtin strategies

## Attempts Log
2025-10-22T21:05:32Z Attempt 2: Core implementation + CLI → pending tests

2025-10-22T21:05:40Z Attempt 3: Added unit tests for replay engine, backtest engine, and CLI backtest command. Ready for verification.
