# TDD Implementation: AI Trading Signals Deterministic Modules

Branch: feat-ai-trading-signals-deterministic-modules-tests | Updated: 2025-10-22T19:40:00Z

## Current Focus

Working on: Implement deterministic strategy modules and tooling for trading signals
Approach: Build strategy heuristics (trend/momentum/risk), prompt templates, tool integration, and supporting tests/fixtures

## Task Progress

- [x] Design prompt templates & reasoning chains
- [x] Implement deterministic strategy modules
- [x] Validate signals with unit tests & fixtures

## Working Notes

2025-10-22T18:40:06Z Created scratchpad and started task analysis.
2025-10-22T18:55:00Z Drafted implementation plan: new prompts module, deterministic trend/momentum/risk heuristics, trading signal tool with LLM guardrails, unit tests with fixtures, update agent config.
2025-10-22T19:35:00Z Added strategy heuristics (trend, momentum, risk), prompt generation helpers, LLM combiner, trading signal tool + skill, fixtures, and comprehensive unit tests.

## Discovered Patterns

- Deterministic signals combine trend/momentum weights with risk adjustments; guard thresholds govern final action downgrades.
- Strategy prompts provide structured reasoning phases aligning with guardrail enforcement.

## Blockers/Questions

- None currently
