# TDD Implementation: Position Management & Execution Manager

Branch: feat-position-management-gmx-perp-exec-manager-tests | Started: 2025-10-22

## Current Focus

Working on: Initial exploration and setup
Approach: Understanding existing codebase and setting up position management service

## Task Progress

- [ ] Create position management service with open/adjust/close operations
- [ ] Implement asynchronous execution manager for transaction lifecycle tracking
- [ ] Create tests with paper-trading/provider stubs
- [ ] Verify transaction payloads, state updates, and error handling

## Evidence Collected

### Existing Infrastructure
- GMX perpetuals schemas exist at: `typescript/onchain-actions-plugins/registry/src/core/schemas/perpetuals.ts`
- Schemas include: Position, Order, CreatePosition, CloseOrder, GetPositions, GetOrders, GetMarkets
- GMX feature file exists with comprehensive scenarios
- Agent-node structure: src/{a2a, ai, cli, config, utils, workflows}
- No existing position management or execution manager services found

### Key Schemas Available
- `CreatePerpetualsPositionRequest`: amount, walletAddress, chainId, marketAddress, payTokenAddress, collateralTokenAddress, referralCode, limitPrice, leverage
- `PerpetualsPosition`: key, account, marketAddress, collateralTokenAddress, sizeInUsd, collateralAmount, positionSide, isLong, pnl
- `PerpetualsOrder`: key, account, marketAddress, orderType, sizeDeltaUsd, positionSide

## Assumptions

1. Position management service should be in agent-node/src (likely new directory)
2. Need to create execution manager for async transaction lifecycle
3. Tests should use MSW/provider stubs for GMX API interactions
4. Should follow existing patterns in agent-node structure

## Working Notes

[2025-10-22 18:16] Starting exploration - examining existing GMX schemas and patterns
[2025-10-22 18:16] Found comprehensive GMX schemas in onchain-actions-plugins
[2025-10-22 18:16] Need to understand if we're extending onchain-actions-plugins or agent-node

## Working Notes

[2025-10-22 18:20] Created comprehensive integration tests for GMXPerpetualManager
[2025-10-22 18:20] Created integration tests for ExecutionManager
[2025-10-22 18:20] Added MSW handlers for GMX API mocking
[2025-10-22 18:20] Created mock data files for various GMX operations
[2025-10-22 18:20] Tests cover: open, adjust, close positions, leverage validation, error handling

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Created test files with comprehensive scenarios
2. âœ… Added MSW handlers for GMX API
3. âœ… Created mock data files
4. ðŸ”„ Now implementing GMXPerpetualManager service
5. ðŸ”„ Now implementing ExecutionManager service

## Discovered Patterns

- MSW handlers use `createResponseFromMock` from utils/error-simulation.ts
- Mock data files have metadata, request, and response sections
- Response body is base64 encoded in rawBody field
- Tests follow pattern: Given/When/Then structure
- Integration tests live alongside source files in src/

## Blockers/Questions

None - proceeding with implementation

## Completion Summary (2025-10-22 18:40)

### Files Created

**Position Management Services:**
- `/typescript/lib/agent-node/src/positions/gmx-perpetuals.ts` - GMX perpetual position manager
- `/typescript/lib/agent-node/src/positions/execution-manager.ts` - Transaction lifecycle manager

**Integration Tests:**
- `/typescript/lib/agent-node/tests/integration/gmx-perpetuals.int.test.ts` - 16 tests for position operations
- `/typescript/lib/agent-node/tests/integration/execution-manager.int.test.ts` - 32 tests for execution tracking

**MSW Handlers:**
- `/typescript/lib/agent-node/tests/mocks/handlers/gmx.ts` - GMX API mock handlers

**Mock Data (11 files):**
- Position opening mocks (long/short, market/limit, fractional leverage)
- Position adjustment mocks
- Position closing mocks (full/partial, profit/loss)
- Position retrieval mocks

### Test Results

**GMXPerpetualManager (16/16 passing):**
- âœ… Open long/short positions with market orders
- âœ… Open positions with limit orders
- âœ… Support fractional leverage (0.5x)
- âœ… Validate leverage bounds
- âœ… Reject insufficient balance
- âœ… Adjust position size (increase/decrease)
- âœ… Close positions (full/partial)
- âœ… Close with profit/loss tracking
- âœ… Retrieve active positions
- âœ… Handle non-existent positions

**ExecutionManager (32/32 passing):**
- âœ… Create and track execution lifecycle
- âœ… Track transaction submission
- âœ… Track transaction confirmation
- âœ… Track transaction failure
- âœ… Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- âœ… Max retry enforcement
- âœ… Idempotency controls (duplicate prevention)
- âœ… Idempotency key generation
- âœ… Confirmation threshold tracking
- âœ… Blockchain reorg handling
- âœ… Query operations (get by ID, list by wallet, filter by status)

### All Tests Status

- âœ… Unit tests passing (where applicable)
- âœ… Integration tests passing (48/48 new tests)
- âœ… `pnpm lint` clean
- âœ… `pnpm build` successful

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Position Management:**
   - Open/adjust/close GMX perpetual positions
   - Support for long/short positions
   - Market and limit order types
   - Leverage validation (0.5x to 50x)
   - Fractional leverage support
   - Balance validation

2. **Execution Manager:**
