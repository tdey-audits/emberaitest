## 📙 Introduction

Welcome to Vibekit, the polyglot toolkit for vibe coding smart, autonomous DeFi agents that can perform complex on-chain operations. Whether you're automating trades, managing liquidity, or integrating with blockchain data, Vibekit makes it simple to create intelligent agents that understand natural language and execute sophisticated workflows.

At its core, Vibekit uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize how agents connect with tools and data, with built-in Agent2Agent (A2A) integration enabling seamless collaboration. The Ember Plugin System extends this foundation with a modular architecture for DeFi protocols, providing standardized entity mapping, comprehensive type safety, and intelligent routing for optimized execution across multiple protocols.

Here's an overview of how everything fits together:

## 🧬 Repository Architecture

Vibekit is structured as a TypeScript monorepo, with a Rust implementation on the horizon.

## ⚡ Quickstart

Follow these steps to build and run DeFi agents:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) with Docker Compose v2.24 or greater installed on your system.

> [!TIP]
> If you are on an M-series Mac, you need to install Docker using the [dmg package](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/) supplied officially by Docker rather than through Homebrew or other means to avoid build issues.

### Get the Code

To get started, clone the repository through command line or your preferred IDE:

```
git clone https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit.git &&
cd arbitrum-vibekit
```

### Run DeFi Agents

The swapping and lending agents start automatically when you launch the Vibekit frontend. Follow the steps below to get everything up and running.

#### Configure Environment Variables

Navigate to the [typescript](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript) directory and create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` and filling in the required values:

```bash
cd typescript &&
cp .env.example .env
```

At a minimum, you need:

- Your preferred AI provider API key (e.g., `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Generate a secure `AUTH_SECRET` (you can use https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 or `openssl rand -base64 32`)

#### Start Services:

```bash
# Start the web frontend and default agents
docker compose up
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you previously ran `docker compose up` with an older version of Vibekit and encounter frontend or database-related errors, clear your browser cache and run the following command in your terminal:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose down && docker volume rm typescript_db_data && docker compose build web --no-cache && docker compose up
> ```

#### Access the Web Interface:

Once all services are running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. To be able to chat with the agents, you need to connect your wallet first. Click on "Connect Wallet" to get started:

  <img src="img/wallet.png" width="900px" alt="wallet"/>
</p>

After setting up your wallet, you'll see the Vibekit web interface where you can explore different agent capabilities:

## 🔧 Build Your Own Agent

To build your own agent, we recommend using our [Quickstart Agent template](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript/templates/quickstart-agent). It provides all the necessary boilerplate code so you can start building right away. Follow these steps to integrate and run the Quickstart Agent:

### Enable the Quickstart Agent in the Frontend

In the [agents-config.ts](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/blob/main/typescript/clients/web/agents-config.ts) file, uncomment the agent's configuration in two places:

```typescript
...
  {
    id: 'quickstart-agent-template' as const,
    name: 'Quickstart',
    description: 'Quickstart agent',
    suggestedActions: [],
  },
...
```

```typescript
...
  ['quickstart-agent-template', 'http://quickstart-agent-template:3007/sse'],
...
```

### Add the Agent to Docker Compose

In the [docker compose](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/blob/main/typescript/compose.yml) file, uncomment the service definition for the Quickstart Agent:

```yaml
---
quickstart-agent-template:
  build:
    context: ./
    dockerfile: templates/quickstart-agent/Dockerfile
  container_name: vibekit-quickstart-agent-template
  env_file:
    - path: .env
      required: true
    - path: templates/quickstart-agent/.env
      required: false
  ports:
    - 3007:3007
  restart: unless-stopped
```

### Configure the Agent's Environment

Navigate to the agent's directory and create a local `.env` by copying the`.env.example` file. Make sure to populate the `.env` file with your API keys and configurations:

```bash
cd typescript/templates/quickstart-agent && cp .env.example .env
```

### Rebuild and Restart Services

Navigate to the [typescript](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript) directory, rebuild the web application and restart all services to apply the changes:

```bash
cd ../.. &&
docker compose build web --no-cache && docker compose up
```

The Quickstart Agent is now accessible through the web frontend:

## 🚀 Deployment

Vibekit supports deployment across multiple environments to suit different use cases:

### Deployment Environments

- **Development**: Local development with hot reloading and debug logging
- **Paper Trading**: Testnet deployment for safe testing with real transactions
- **Production**: Optimized deployment for mainnet with security hardening

### Quick Deploy Commands

```bash
cd typescript

# Development environment
pnpm deploy:dev

# Paper trading (testnet)
pnpm deploy:paper

# Production
pnpm deploy:prod

# Validate environment configuration
pnpm validate:env
```

## 🤖 LLM Guides

### `.rulesync` Configuration

The `.rulesync` directory serves as the source of truth for all LLM configuration files. This system allows you to manage rules, commands, and subagents in a centralized location and automatically generate them for different AI tools:

```
.rulesync/
├── commands/           # High-level command structures
├── subagents/          # Persona-driven specialized agents
└── rules/              # Workspace-wide guidelines and best practices
```

Key Benefits:

- **Single Source of Truth**: All LLM configurations managed in one place
- **Automatic Generation**: Run `pnpm sync:rules` to generate files for Claude, Cursor, and other tools
- **Version Control**: Track changes to AI configurations alongside code changes
- **Consistency**: Ensure all AI tools follow the same guidelines and workflows

To generate all LLM configuration files, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm sync:rules

# Files are automatically generated to:
# - .claude/ (for Claude Code)
# - .cursor/ (for Cursor IDE)
```

### Claude

For Claude models, prompt engineering is handled through a set of dedicated files in the [`.claude/`](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/.claude) directory. These files include detailed instructions, examples, and best practices to guide LLMs in generating accurate and efficient code:

- **agents/**: Contains prompts for persona-driven agents that specialize in tasks like Test-Driven Development, documentation, and feature writing.
- **commands/**: Includes prompts that define high-level command structures for planning, execution, and version control.
- **hooks/**: Provides scripts that can be triggered at different stages of the development lifecycle, such as pre-task and post-task actions.

Additionally, [`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) provides comprehensive guidance for Claude Code when working with the Vibekit codebase, including architecture overview, development standards, and code quality guidelines.

### Cursor

Cursor rules files are located in the [`.cursor/rules`](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/.cursor/rules) directory. These files define best practices, workflows, and workspace conventions for building and maintaining agents:

- **createVibekitAgent.mdc**: A guide for creating and configuring new agents, including best practices, required dependencies, and setup instructions.

- **vibeCodingWorkflow.mdc**: Outlines the step-by-step development workflow for agents, including the Planner/Executor roles, task breakdowns, and conventions for collaborative development.

- **workspaceRules.mdc**: Documents workspace-wide guidelines and best practices for the monorepo, such as dependency management, development scripts, and CI/CD standards.
