# Camelot (Cryptocurrency Protocol)

Camelot is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol comprising a **community-driven decentralized exchange (DEX)** and a **token launchpad** on the Arbitrum network. It launched in late 2022 with the goal of becoming Arbitrum’s native DEX, providing flexible liquidity infrastructure for new projects and yielding sustainable rewards for participants ([What is Camelot (GRAIL)?](https://www.gate.io/learn/articles/what-is-camelot/784#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20an%20ecosystem,sustainable%2C%20and%20highly%20adaptive%20liquidity)) ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20a%20decentralized%20and,diverse%20and%20expansive%20Arbitrum%20ecosystem)). Camelot has since grown into a broader “**Orbital Liquidity Network**,” expanding its liquidity services across multiple Arbitrum “Orbit” chains while remaining centered on the Arbitrum ecosystem ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=With%20the%20expansion%20of%20Arbitrum,deployed%20on%208%20Orbit%20chains)) ([Introducing Camelot as the First Orbital Liquidity Network | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://medium.com/@camelotdex/introducing-camelot-as-the-first-orbital-liquidity-network-8434101bc6fd#:~:text=is%20a%20natural%20evolution%2C%20with,of%20the%20core%20Camelot%20vision)). The protocol is best known for its **GRAIL** and **xGRAIL** tokens, innovative automated market maker design, and its Round Table partnership program supporting dozens of Arbitrum projects.

## Historical Overview

**Origins and Launch (2022):** Camelot’s core team (pseudonymous and community-based) began development in 2022, evolving from an earlier project called Excalibur on Fantom. The new DEX was **entirely self-funded with no venture capital**, opting for a fair community launch ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=,in%20xGRAIL)) ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=%2A%20There%20was%20no%20pre,or%20VC%20investment)). Camelot’s public token sale ran from November 29 to December 5, 2022, auctioning **15% of the total 100,000 GRAIL supply**. The sale had a starting price floor of $20 (implying a $2 million initial valuation) and no hard cap ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=The%20public%20sale%20began%20on,hours%20after%20the%20sale%20ended)) ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=,on%20the%20total%20amount%20deposited)). Strong demand drove the final clearing price to about **$254 per GRAIL**, raising roughly **$3.8 million** in total ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=)). Notably, _legacy_ Excalibur token holders were offered a 10% discount in the Camelot sale as a bridge for the earlier community ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=supply%20to)). After the sale, GRAIL trading liquidity went live on Arbitrum, seeded by the protocol which paired 7.5% of GRAIL supply with funds from the sale (Protocol-Owned Liquidity) ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=)).

**Genesis Phase (late 2022 – early 2023):** To bootstrap adoption, Camelot launched **“Genesis Farms”** in late November 2022. These special yield farms allowed early liquidity providers to deposit assets before GRAIL’s launch and earn rewards in xGRAIL (Camelot’s escrowed token) over the next six months ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=,to%20depositors%20from%20November%2023rd)) ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=,existing%20Nitro%20pool%20reward%20structure)). Some genesis pools also paid out partner project tokens as extra incentives ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=following%20the%20public%20sale%20and,redirected%20to%20the%20remaining%20participants)). This helped Camelot build initial liquidity and engage the Arbitrum community ahead of the DEX’s full launch. By the time Camelot DEX went live in December 2022, it had already aligned with a number of **“Round Table” partners** – Arbitrum protocols who committed liquidity or launched incentives on Camelot.

**Rapid Growth in the Arbitrum Ecosystem (Q1 2023):** In the first months of 2023, Camelot quickly became a centerpiece of Arbitrum DeFi activity ([What is Camelot (GRAIL)?](https://www.gate.io/learn/articles/what-is-camelot/784#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20primarily%20a%20native,leading%20native%20DEX%20on%20Arbitrum)). The platform consistently onboarded new users and projects, helping **over 10 protocols launch** their tokens via Camelot by early 2023 ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=supporting%20projects%20big%20and%20small,coming%20to%20Arbitrum)). Notable Arbitrum-native projects such as **Factor DAO, Vela Exchange, Plutus DAO (Arbitrove),** and others conducted their initial token sales or liquidity launches on Camelot’s launchpad. For example, **Factor DAO**, an on-chain asset management platform, held a fair-launch offering on Camelot in February 2023 that raised ~$7.6 million from over 4,000 participants ([Factor Raises $7.6 Million in Token Offering on Camelot, Starts ...](https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/factor-raises-7.6-million-in-token-offering-on-camelot-starts-trading-on-saturday#:~:text=Factor%20Raises%20%247,which%20began%20on%20February)) ([Factor (FCTR) Live Price, Factor Team and Founder | TokenInsight](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/factor/team#:~:text=Factor%20Raises%20%247,Token%20Offering%20on%20Camelot)). Camelot’s TVL (total value locked) and trading volumes surged as Arbitrum itself gained popularity; by March 2023 – just ahead of Arbitrum’s airdrop – Camelot’s TVL had exceeded **$100 million**, making it one of the largest protocols on Arbitrum ([Arbitrum-Based Camelot Crypto Exchange to Deploy V2 Upgrade Saturday](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/07/arbitrum-based-camelot-crypto-exchange-to-deploy-v2-upgrade-saturday#:~:text=CoinGecko%20data,15%20at%20press%20time)). This success was fueled by Camelot’s deep liquidity for many Arbitrum tokens and lucrative yield farms, though some critics pointed out the DEX’s complex UI and yield-focused design as areas to improve.

**Upgrades and New Features (2023):** In April 2023, Camelot rolled out a major upgrade referred to as **“Camelot v2”** (not to be confused with the token launch version) to improve capital efficiency and user experience. This upgrade introduced a **concentrated-liquidity AMM** powered by Algebra’s technology, in effect a Camelot **AMM V3** deployment (the third iteration of its market maker) ([┃AMM V3 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v3#:~:text=Last%20updated%203%20months%20ago)) ([┃AMM V3 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v3#:~:text=Directional%20%26%20Dynamic%20Volatility%20Fees)). Launched on April 8, 2023, this new AMM allowed liquidity providers to concentrate their funds in specific price ranges (similar to Uniswap v3), and added **dynamic fees** that adjust based on market volatility ([┃AMM V3 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v3#:~:text=Directional%20%26%20Dynamic%20Volatility%20Fees)). The upgrade was implemented in phases: first the Algebra-based AMM beta, then a refreshed user interface, followed by new farming contracts for the concentrated pools ([Camelot V2 — Concentrated Liquidity, UI overhaul & High-Efficiency Farms | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-v2-concentrated-liquidity-ui-overhaul-high-efficiency-farms-5e22e53dff87#:~:text=V2%20will%20launch%20in%20three,deployed%20on%20Saturday%208th%2C%20April)). Camelot’s pseudonymous founder “**Myrddin**” announced these changes via Discord and Twitter, emphasizing that the goal was to move Camelot beyond being just a high-APR yield farm and towards a more **“user-focused”** and efficient DEX infrastructure ([Camelot V2 — Concentrated Liquidity, UI overhaul & High-Efficiency Farms | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-v2-concentrated-liquidity-ui-overhaul-high-efficiency-farms-5e22e53dff87#:~:text=The%20initial%20goal%20for%20Camelot,The%20efficiency%20of%20our%20first)) ([Arbitrum-Based Camelot Crypto Exchange to Deploy V2 Upgrade Saturday](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/07/arbitrum-based-camelot-crypto-exchange-to-deploy-v2-upgrade-saturday#:~:text=The%20upgrade%20will%20launch%20in,the%20rebasing%20tokens%20like%20stETH)). The introduction of concentrated liquidity (termed Camelot AMM v3) indeed made trading on Camelot more efficient – by early 2025 Camelot’s concentrated pools (V3) had facilitated over **$50 billion** in cumulative trading volume, far surpassing the usage of its original pools ([Algebra & Camelot: The Future of DEX Performance on Arbitrum & Orbit Chains | by Algebra | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@crypto_algebra/algebra-camelot-the-future-of-dex-performance-on-arbitrum-orbit-chains-d29078db96b8#:~:text=With%20Algebra%E2%80%99s%20technology%2C%20Camelot%20V3,Let%E2%80%99s%20examine%20its%20impact)) ([Algebra & Camelot: The Future of DEX Performance on Arbitrum & Orbit Chains | by Algebra | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@crypto_algebra/algebra-camelot-the-future-of-dex-performance-on-arbitrum-orbit-chains-d29078db96b8#:~:text=Cumulative%20Performance%3A)).

**Ecosystem Expansion and Partnerships:** Throughout 2023, Camelot solidified a **“Round Table”** program – a collaborative initiative aligning Camelot with many other Arbitrum projects. Participants in the Round Table spanned a wide range of DeFi and Web3 applications on Arbitrum. For example, liquidity protocols like **Liquity (LUSD)** and **Pendle** integrated their tokens’ liquidity into Camelot, cross-chain services like **Hop Protocol** and **Relay Chain** used Camelot for Arbitrum pools, and emerging native projects such as **Factor DAO**, **Vela Exchange**, **Tarot**, **Redacted Cartel**, **Lyra**, **Silo**, and many more joined as partners ([Camelot DEX - Exchanges | IQ.wiki](https://iq.wiki/wiki/camelot-dex#:~:text=Some%20protocols%20that%20are%20participant,12)). These partnerships often meant joint liquidity mining campaigns (via Camelot’s Nitro program), token launch collaborations, or simply mutual support whereby Camelot listed and incentivized those tokens. Camelot also partnered with external DeFi service providers to enhance its platform – notably **Gamma Strategies** (which provided active management vaults for Camelot’s concentrated liquidity pools) and **Algebra** (the developer of the AMM engine Camelot uses). In mid-2023, Camelot made headlines by proposing an ambitious **Arbitrum DAO grant** to further boost ecosystem growth, requesting a share of Arbitrum’s treasury tokens to fund liquidity incentives for new projects ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=the%20community%20aspect%20of%20Arbitrum,L1)) ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=While%20the%20proposed%20amount%20might,bet%20and%20see%20what%20happens)). (The proposal sparked debate in the Arbitrum community about Camelot’s user experience and the merits of such large incentives ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=banterltyics%20%20July%2010%2C%202023%2C,12%3A36pm%20%20199)), illustrating Camelot’s prominence and the community’s high expectations.)

**Orbital Expansion (2024):** By its one-year anniversary, Camelot had firmly established itself as Arbitrum’s largest native DEX (over 75 partner projects and **>$27 million in cumulative fees** generated by late 2024) ([Introducing Camelot as the First Orbital Liquidity Network | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://medium.com/@camelotdex/introducing-camelot-as-the-first-orbital-liquidity-network-8434101bc6fd#:~:text=achieve%20long,want%20to%20achieve%20sustainable%20liquidity)) ([Introducing Camelot as the First Orbital Liquidity Network | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://medium.com/@camelotdex/introducing-camelot-as-the-first-orbital-liquidity-network-8434101bc6fd#:~:text=over%2075%20partners%2C%20generating%20,want%20to%20achieve%20sustainable%20liquidity)). The team then set its sights on expanding Camelot’s model beyond the main Arbitrum One chain. In mid-2024, Offchain Labs introduced **Arbitrum Orbit**, a framework for launching new Layer-2 or Layer-3 chains using Arbitrum’s technology. Camelot embraced this opportunity and evolved its vision into what it calls an **“Orbital Liquidity Network.”** In August 2024, Camelot announced it had become the first (and at the time only) Arbitrum-native protocol to **deploy on multiple Orbit chains** – serving as the DEX and liquidity provider for a growing roster of Arbitrum-connected chains ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=With%20the%20expansion%20of%20Arbitrum,deployed%20on%208%20Orbit%20chains)) ([Introducing Camelot as the First Orbital Liquidity Network | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://medium.com/@camelotdex/introducing-camelot-as-the-first-orbital-liquidity-network-8434101bc6fd#:~:text=is%20a%20natural%20evolution%2C%20with,of%20the%20core%20Camelot%20vision)). By early 2025 Camelot was live on _eight_ different Orbit chains (such as **Sanko, XAI, Reya, WINR,** and others) providing those ecosystems with trading infrastructure ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=With%20the%20expansion%20of%20Arbitrum,deployed%20on%208%20Orbit%20chains)). This expansion came with a refreshed Camelot brand (often referring to the platform as “the Castle”) and a commitment to act as “glue” connecting liquidity across the Arbitrum multi-chain universe ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20a%20decentralized%20and,diverse%20and%20expansive%20Arbitrum%20ecosystem)) ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=Becoming%20the%20Orbital%20Liquidity%20Network)). Camelot even hinted at a future **GRAIL token split or rework** to accommodate multi-chain growth (e.g. potentially creating chain-specific versions of GRAIL), though GRAIL’s core role as the unified value-capture token would remain ([Introducing Camelot as the First Orbital Liquidity Network | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://medium.com/@camelotdex/introducing-camelot-as-the-first-orbital-liquidity-network-8434101bc6fd#:~:text=The%20GRAIL%20token%20has%20always,the%20rapid%20expansion%20across%20Orbit)).

**Recent Developments (late 2024 – 2025):** Alongside the orbital expansion, Camelot’s team continued upgrading the protocol’s technology. In late 2024, a **fourth-generation AMM** was introduced in beta (Camelot AMM v4), coinciding with an overhaul of the liquidity incentive system. The AMM v4 is based on Algebra’s **“Integral” v1.2** release, which uses a modular smart contract architecture with **pluggable modules** for features like dynamic fees and custom incentives ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=Key%20Features)) ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=4)). This upgrade brought gas optimizations and the ability to support special token types (like rebasing tokens) and to create multiple customizable pools per token pair ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=2)) ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=6)). It essentially allows Camelot to attach _plugins_ to liquidity pools – for example, to implement advanced fee logic or security measures – without altering the core pool contracts ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=4)) ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=Plugins)). Concurrently, Camelot launched a new **unified incentive program** to replace the original Nitro pools. Announced in December 2024, this system lets any project permissionlessly create a liquidity mining campaign on Camelot (for either v2 or v3/v4 pools) with fine-grained parameters, and it simplifies user rewards claiming via Merkle proofs ([Camelot’s new modular system beta launch | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelots-new-modular-system-beta-launch-1fac50ea9e32#:~:text=customizable%20way,directly%20to%20the%20Arbitrum%20community)) ([Camelot’s new modular system beta launch | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelots-new-modular-system-beta-launch-1fac50ea9e32#:~:text=Key%20features)). The new incentive model was built to better accommodate concentrated liquidity positions and is highly modular, aiming to improve on the earlier Nitro mechanism which had limitations for v3 pools ([Camelot’s new modular system beta launch | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelots-new-modular-system-beta-launch-1fac50ea9e32#:~:text=initial%20design%2C%20largely%20driven%20by,support%20the%20full%20features%20needed)) ([Camelot’s new modular system beta launch | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelots-new-modular-system-beta-launch-1fac50ea9e32#:~:text=,modes%2C%20token%20weight%2C%20min%2Fmax%20depth%E2%80%A6)). As of April 2025, Camelot continues to be a major DeFi hub on Arbitrum – it has facilitated over **$30 billion in total trading volume** and distributed “real yield” to GRAIL stakers from protocol revenues ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20a%20decentralized%20and,diverse%20and%20expansive%20Arbitrum%20ecosystem)) – while also serving as a cross-chain liquidity network for Arbitrum’s expanding orbit of chains.

## Protocol Design and Features

Camelot’s protocol is centered on its **automated market maker (AMM)** DEX, which allows users to swap tokens and provide liquidity to earn fees. The design is highly flexible, incorporating multiple AMM versions and customization features:

- **Dual AMM (V2)** – Camelot’s initial AMM (often called V2) implemented a hybrid of Uniswap V2 and Curve-style mechanisms ([What is Camelot (GRAIL)?](https://www.gate.io/learn/articles/what-is-camelot/784#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20primarily%20a%20native,leading%20native%20DEX%20on%20Arbitrum)). In practice, this meant Camelot had two types of liquidity pools: one type for **volatile token pairs** using the standard constant-product formula (x \* y = k), and another type for **stable pairs** using an invariant suitable for assets with correlated prices (like USDC/USDT) ([Camelot V2 — Concentrated Liquidity, UI overhaul & High-Efficiency Farms | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-v2-concentrated-liquidity-ui-overhaul-high-efficiency-farms-5e22e53dff87#:~:text=The%20initial%20goal%20for%20Camelot,The%20efficiency%20of%20our%20first)). This “dual-liquidity” setup gave Camelot the ability to offer **low-slippage swaps for stablecoins** while still efficiently handling volatile assets ([What is Camelot (GRAIL)?](https://www.gate.io/learn/articles/what-is-camelot/784#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20primarily%20a%20native,leading%20native%20DEX%20on%20Arbitrum)). Liquidity providers (LPs) in Camelot V2 received an NFT representation of their staked position – dubbed an **spNFT** (staked position NFT) – which enabled additional functionality like time-locking liquidity for higher rewards ([Camelot DEX - Exchanges | IQ.wiki](https://iq.wiki/wiki/camelot-dex#:~:text=The%20structure%20of%20Camelot%20makes,2)) ([Camelot DEX - Exchanges | IQ.wiki](https://iq.wiki/wiki/camelot-dex#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20a%20decentralized%20exchange,2)). Camelot V2 also introduced **dynamic directional fees**, meaning swap fees can be set independently for buys vs. sells and can vary by pool ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20a%20strong%20team,that%20often%20go%20unnoticed%2C%20specifically)) ([┃AMM V3 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v3#:~:text=Directional%20%26%20Dynamic%20Volatility%20Fees)). For example, a token pool could charge a higher fee on sells than on buys if a partner project wants to discourage sell pressure – a feature used to customize incentives for different pools. Another innovation was **Nitro Pools**, which allowed projects to permissionlessly offer their own token rewards to liquidity providers on Camelot with specific conditions (e.g. requiring that LP tokens be time-locked to earn the extra rewards) ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=,coming%20soon)). Nitro pools gave protocols fine-grained control to “boost” liquidity in a targeted way without Camelot governance overhead. In summary, Camelot’s first-generation design was an enhanced Uniswap V2 model focused on **flexibility (custom fees, dual pool types) and deeper liquidity for partner tokens** ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20a%20strong%20team,that%20often%20go%20unnoticed%2C%20specifically)) ([Camelot welcomes Factor to the Round Table | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-welcomes-factor-to-the-round-table-34fb994c3d5f#:~:text=,capture%20real%20yield%20for%20holders)).

- **Concentrated Liquidity AMMs (V3 and V4)** – In 2023, Camelot upgraded its AMM to incorporate **concentrated liquidity**, where LPs can allocate capital within specific price ranges rather than across all prices. Camelot partnered with the Algebra protocol to power this functionality. The **Camelot AMM V3** (launched April 2023) is built on Algebra’s v1.9 codebase ([┃AMM V3 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v3#:~:text=Last%20updated%203%20months%20ago)). It works similarly to Uniswap v3, using **price ticks** and per-range liquidity positions, but with additional enhancements. Notably, Camelot V3 supports **customizable tick spacing** for each pool (allowing fine control over price granularity) and **volatility-adjusted fees** that automatically increase fees during periods of high price volatility ([┃AMM V3 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v3#:~:text=Customizable%20Tickspacing)) ([┃AMM V3 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v3#:~:text=Directional%20%26%20Dynamic%20Volatility%20Fees)). It even permits setting different fee tiers for each trade direction (buy vs sell) on concentrated pools ([┃AMM V3 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v3#:~:text=V3%20introduces%20a%20fee%20structure,fee%20generation%20and%20trade%20volume)), combining the directional fee concept with Uniswap v3-like liquidity. These features improve fee capture and reduce impermanent loss for LPs by tailoring each pool to the asset’s behavior. Building on V3, Camelot introduced **AMM V4** in late 2024, leveraging Algebra’s next-gen “Integral” AMM (version 1.2) ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=Camelot%20integrates%20the%201,for%20traders%20and%20liquidity%20providers)). Algebra Integral brought a **modular architecture**: the core AMM logic (concentrated liquidity and swap math) remains immutable, but non-core modules like fees, oracles, incentive logic, etc., can be upgraded or customized via **plug-in contracts** ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=,enhanced%20functionality%20for%20the%20protocol)) ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=,enabling%20unparalleled%20customization%20and%20flexibility)). In Camelot’s implementation, plugins are used to implement **adaptive fees** (dynamic fee schedules that can replace having multiple pool fee tiers), **sliding fees** (fees that adjust with trade size or other conditions), improved price oracles, and emergency controls for pools ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=The%20current%20set%20of%20plugins,by%20Camelot%20is%20the%20following)) ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=3)). The V4 also improved gas efficiency and added native support for **rebasing tokens** (ensuring that any rebased supply is properly credited to LPs rather than “stuck” in the pool) ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=5)). For users, Camelot’s V3/V4 concentrated liquidity pools offer much higher capital efficiency – more liquidity at the active price – resulting in tighter spreads for traders. To simplify the experience, Camelot provides both an **“auto” mode and a “manual” mode** for adding concentrated liquidity ([┃AMM V3 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v3#:~:text=,concentrated)). Less experienced users can use auto mode (where the UI or a manager contract places liquidity in a broad, optimized range), while advanced users can precisely choose price bounds. By early 2025, concentrated pools have become the dominant venue for trading on Camelot, handling the majority of volume and outperforming the old pools in fee generation by over 8x ([Algebra & Camelot: The Future of DEX Performance on Arbitrum & Orbit Chains | by Algebra | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@crypto_algebra/algebra-camelot-the-future-of-dex-performance-on-arbitrum-orbit-chains-d29078db96b8#:~:text=With%20Algebra%E2%80%99s%20technology%2C%20Camelot%20V3,Let%E2%80%99s%20examine%20its%20impact)) ([Algebra & Camelot: The Future of DEX Performance on Arbitrum & Orbit Chains | by Algebra | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@crypto_algebra/algebra-camelot-the-future-of-dex-performance-on-arbitrum-orbit-chains-d29078db96b8#:~:text=Camelot%20V3%3A)).

- **Launchpad (Public Sale Platform):** In addition to swaps, Camelot features a built-in **launchpad** for new token sales. It uses a **fair launch auction model**, similar to Camelot’s own token sale, where a token’s price is determined by the total funds contributed during the sale window (all purchasers receive the token at the same final price) ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=,on%20the%20total%20amount%20deposited)) ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=)). This model lowers barriers to entry – anyone can participate permissionlessly with typically just Arbitrum **USDC**, and early contributors are rewarded via mechanisms like bonus xGRAIL (Camelot offered xGRAIL bonuses to early buyers in its sale) ([Arbitrum-Based Camelot Crypto Exchange to Deploy V2 Upgrade Saturday](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/07/arbitrum-based-camelot-crypto-exchange-to-deploy-v2-upgrade-saturday#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAll%20contributions%20before%20Dec%201st,xGRAIL%2C%E2%80%9D%20wrote%20Camelot%20on%20Twitter)). Camelot’s launchpad has been used by numerous Arbitrum projects to conduct initial DEX offerings. By mid-2023, it had facilitated **11 token sales raising a combined ~$38 million USDC** ([Camelot – Decentralized Launchpad for Early-Stage Token Access | CryptoRank.io](https://cryptorank.io/fundraising-platforms/camelot#:~:text=Image%3A%20Total%20Funds%20Raised%20Icon)). The platform is **permissionless** (projects can apply or launch without subjective vetting by Camelot, though Camelot may curate to filter obvious bad actors) ([Camelot – Decentralized Launchpad for Early-Stage Token Access | CryptoRank.io](https://cryptorank.io/fundraising-platforms/camelot#:~:text=Does%20the%20Camelot%20team%20audit,projects%20looking%20to%20use%20Launchpad)) ([Camelot – Decentralized Launchpad for Early-Stage Token Access | CryptoRank.io](https://cryptorank.io/fundraising-platforms/camelot#:~:text=How%20to%20calculate%20Circ)). Users who hold Camelot’s xGRAIL token gain certain perks for launchpad sales – for example, the Camelot UI notes that allocating (staking) xGRAIL can grant **exclusive benefits or higher sale allocations** in partner IDOs ([Launchpad - Camelot DEX | Arbitrum native Decentralized Exchange](https://app.camelot.exchange/xgrail/launchpad/#:~:text=Exchange%20app,from%20all%20our%20Launchpad%20partners)). Overall, the launchpad complements Camelot’s DEX by guiding fresh liquidity to the exchange and strengthening Camelot’s position as an **ecosystem incubator** on Arbitrum.

- **xGRAIL and Plugins:** A distinctive element of Camelot’s design is its two-tier token system: **GRAIL** is the primary utility and governance token, while **xGRAIL** is a staked, non-transferrable token that unlocks special features. When users stake GRAIL into the Camelot staking contract, they receive xGRAIL at a 1:1 rate (minus a small conversion fee) ([┃xGRAIL Token | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/xgrail-token#:~:text=Name%3A%20Camelot%20Escrowed%20Token%20Ticker%3A,xGRAIL%20Chain%3A%20Arbitrum%20Contract)). xGRAIL represents an **escrowed form of GRAIL** – it cannot be traded or moved between wallets, but it can be converted back to liquid GRAIL (over a vesting period or instantly by paying a penalty). The main purpose of xGRAIL is to **allocate it to various “plugins”** within Camelot’s ecosystem ([┃xGRAIL Token | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/xgrail-token#:~:text=xGRAIL%20is%20a%20non,or%20through%20direct%20GRAIL%20conversion)) ([┃xGRAIL Token | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/xgrail-token#:~:text=The%20central%20use%20case%20for,in%20exchange%20for%20various%20benefits)). By assigning xGRAIL to a plugin, the user “locks in” that xGRAIL for a chosen use and in return receives a benefit. Camelot’s plugins (which can be thought of as modular staking options) include: **Real Yield staking**, which distributes a share of protocol earnings (trading fees) to xGRAIL holders; **Yield Boosters**, which let an LP stake xGRAIL to boost the rewards APR on a specific farming pool; and **Governance/Community plugins**, which may grant privileged access or voting power in certain partner project sales, etc ([Camelot welcomes Factor to the Round Table | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-welcomes-factor-to-the-round-table-34fb994c3d5f#:~:text=,capture%20real%20yield%20for%20holders)) ([Camelot welcomes Factor to the Round Table | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-welcomes-factor-to-the-round-table-34fb994c3d5f#:~:text=Camelot%20will%20leverage%20all%20its,deposit%20over%20a%20certain%20amount)). For instance, a liquidity provider might allocate some xGRAIL to boost their rewards in an ETH-Arbitrum token pool, and allocate another portion of xGRAIL to earn a cut of DEX fee revenue. This system is an **innovative escrowed tokenomics model** that aligns long-term GRAIL stakers with the protocol: users are incentivized to hold GRAIL as xGRAIL to get more rewards, while the locking reduces circulating supply and helps sustain GRAIL’s value ([Camelot welcomes Factor to the Round Table | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-welcomes-factor-to-the-round-table-34fb994c3d5f#:~:text=,capture%20real%20yield%20for%20holders)) ([Camelot welcomes Factor to the Round Table | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-welcomes-factor-to-the-round-table-34fb994c3d5f#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20we%20could%20set,that%20benefits%20the%20entire%20ecosystem)). Notably, xGRAIL _cannot_ be transferred or sold, so only those who originally staked GRAIL can utilize its benefits ([┃xGRAIL Token | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/xgrail-token#:~:text=xGRAIL%20is%20a%20non,or%20through%20direct%20GRAIL%20conversion)). GRAIL and xGRAIL are freely interconvertible (subject to vesting) which means participants can choose between liquidity (GRAIL) or utility (xGRAIL) at any time ([What is Camelot (GRAIL)?](https://www.gate.io/learn/articles/what-is-camelot/784#:~:text=Source%3A%20Camelot%20Official%20Documentation)). This dual-token design helps Camelot **capture value (via fees and buy-backs) and return value to committed users**, creating a real-yield earning mechanism rather than relying solely on inflation.

- **Fee and Revenue Model:** Camelot charges swap fees on trades like any DEX, but its fee distribution is tailored to support the GRAIL token economy. In Camelot’s V2 pools, the fee split was: **60% to LP providers**, **27.5% to xGRAIL stakers** (as “real yield”), **12.5% to buy back and burn GRAIL**, and 5% to the Camelot treasury for operations ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=V2)) ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=V2)). This meant a portion of every trade directly created buy pressure on GRAIL (reducing supply) and rewarded long-term holders via xGRAIL dividends. With the introduction of V3 concentrated pools, the fee allocation was adjusted (LPs receive a larger 85% share given the greater capital efficiency, while a smaller portion – around 8.5% – goes to xGRAIL stakers, 3.5% to buy/burn, etc.) ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=V3)). But the overarching idea remains: **Camelot converts part of its protocol revenue into value for GRAIL holders**, either through direct distribution or token burns, ensuring that GRAIL benefits from the exchange’s growth. As of early 2025, Camelot had generated over **$52 million in cumulative trading fees** for the protocol, underpinning its real-yield model for GRAIL ([Algebra & Camelot: The Future of DEX Performance on Arbitrum & Orbit Chains | by Algebra | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@crypto_algebra/algebra-camelot-the-future-of-dex-performance-on-arbitrum-orbit-chains-d29078db96b8#:~:text=partners%2C%20generating%20,to%20be%20a%20decentralized%20exchange)). This deflationary and value-sharing approach is aimed at making Camelot’s tokenomics sustainable long-term (in contrast to pure emission-driven reward models).

## Ecosystem and Associated Projects

Camelot positions itself as an **ecosystem hub** on Arbitrum, not just a standalone exchange. From its inception, it actively cultivated a community of partner projects and provided them with infrastructure and liquidity. Key aspects of Camelot’s ecosystem involvement include its **Round Table partnerships, Launchpad projects, and multi-chain deployments**:

- **Round Table Program:** “The Round Table” is Camelot’s umbrella for strategic partnerships with other protocols. The name, harkening to the Knights of Camelot, signifies an alliance of equals – projects that build on Arbitrum and mutually support each other. By mid-2023, Camelot had **close relationships with over 65 projects** in the Arbitrum ecosystem ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=supporting%20projects%20big%20and%20small,coming%20to%20Arbitrum)). These range from DeFi primitives to gaming and NFT projects. A partial list of Round Table members includes yield and lending protocols (**Pendle, Silo, Tarot**), infrastructure projects (**Hop Bridge, LayerZero/Relay**), stablecoin and finance platforms (**Liquity, Redacted**), Arbitrum-native DeFi startups (**Factor DAO, Plutus DAO, Vela Exchange, Perpy**), and others ([Camelot DEX - Exchanges | IQ.wiki](https://iq.wiki/wiki/camelot-dex#:~:text=Some%20protocols%20that%20are%20participant,12)). For these partners, Camelot provides technical and liquidity support – for example, setting up liquidity pools on Camelot, co-marketing their launch events, and offering customized Nitro reward programs. In return, these projects often choose Camelot as their primary DEX or launch venue on Arbitrum. This collaborative model helped Camelot rapidly expand its network effect; each new project brought in its community and token liquidity, which increased Camelot’s overall activity. An illustration of this is **Factor DAO’s launch**: Camelot not only hosted Factor’s token sale but also committed to deepening Factor’s token liquidity and enabling special Nitro rewards for FCTR LPs ([Camelot welcomes Factor to the Round Table | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-welcomes-factor-to-the-round-table-34fb994c3d5f#:~:text=,capture%20real%20yield%20for%20holders)) ([Camelot welcomes Factor to the Round Table | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-welcomes-factor-to-the-round-table-34fb994c3d5f#:~:text=Camelot%20will%20leverage%20all%20its,deposit%20over%20a%20certain%20amount)). This level of integration made Camelot _the place_ to trade those new tokens and cemented its role as a launch partner. The Round Table concept also extended to joint governance discussions – Camelot has advocated within Arbitrum DAO forums on behalf of all native projects for incentive programs that benefit the ecosystem ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=the%20community%20aspect%20of%20Arbitrum,L1)) ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=While%20the%20proposed%20amount%20might,bet%20and%20see%20what%20happens)). By fostering a tight-knit community of builders around it, Camelot amplifies the growth of the Arbitrum network as a whole.

- **Launchpad Projects:** Camelot’s **Launchpad (token sale platform)** has been a major on-ramp for new ecosystem projects. Since Camelot’s own fair launch, at least a dozen projects have conducted public sales on Camelot. The **average raise per project** is on the order of $3–4 million ([Camelot – Decentralized Launchpad for Early-Stage Token Access | CryptoRank.io](https://cryptorank.io/fundraising-platforms/camelot#:~:text=N%2FA)), with some notable examples listed below. All sales have used the fair auction model where contributors receive the project’s tokens at the same final price (determined by total funds raised) ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=,on%20the%20total%20amount%20deposited)). Typically, a portion of the raise or tokens is allocated to Camelot or requires locking via xGRAIL, aligning incentives between the new project and Camelot’s community.

  - _Factor DAO (FCTR):_ The largest launch on Camelot to date, Factor’s sale in Feb 2023 raised **$7.6M USDC** (out of a $10M target) in exchange for 10% of FCTR supply ([Factor Raises $7.6 Million in Token Offering on Camelot, Starts ...](https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/factor-raises-7.6-million-in-token-offering-on-camelot-starts-trading-on-saturday#:~:text=Factor%20Raises%20%247,which%20began%20on%20February)) ([Factor (FCTR) Live Price, Factor Team and Founder | TokenInsight](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/factor/team#:~:text=Factor%20Raises%20%247,Token%20Offering%20on%20Camelot)). Over 4,000 wallets participated. The sale started at $0.10 per FCTR (implying $10M FDV) and ended at ~$0.75 per FCTR (final ~$75M FDV) – all buyers paid the final price. This successful offering helped Factor kickstart its product and provided deep liquidity on Camelot for FCTR trading immediately after launch. Following the sale, Factor’s token was integrated into Camelot farms with Nitro rewards, and Factor joined Camelot’s Round Table. The Camelot team touted this as a model example of fair launch success on Arbitrum ([Arbitrum-Based FactorDAO Releases Staking Service, Developers ...](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/28/arbitrum-based-factordao-releases-staking-service-amid-code-controversy#:~:text=Arbitrum,price%20of%2075%20cents)).

  - _Arbitrove (TROVE):_ Arbitrove is a yield index protocol by Plutus DAO. In early 2023 it launched the TROVE token via Camelot. The sale mechanism was slightly unique (involving an NFT phase to raise funds that would be converted to TROVE), but Camelot served as the platform where TROVE’s initial price discovery and liquidity bootstrap occurred. The event drew significant interest as TROVE represented a diversified Arbitrum yield index. Camelot listed TROVE and supported its liquidity mining post-launch, contributing to TROVE reaching a large market cap for a new project. This marked one of the first index tokens launched on Camelot.

  - _Vela Exchange (VELA):_ Vela, a decentralized perps trading platform on Arbitrum, conducted a token sale/airdrop on Camelot around January 2023. Vela had an existing community (formerly under a different name, DXP), but used Camelot to distribute its new token and establish a market. Camelot hosted the VELA trading pool and enabled yield farming for VELA pairs. The partnership gave Vela traders immediate liquidity while bringing perpetuals traders onto Camelot. VELA’s price action and trading volume on Camelot were substantial during Arbitrum’s bull run in Q1 2023, further validating Camelot’s launchpad approach.

  - _Other launches:_ Camelot’s launchpad was also utilized by projects like **Magpie XYZ (Penpie)**, **Jones DAO**, **Yieldification (YDF)**, and several smaller GameFi and infrastructure projects through 2023. In total, by late 2023, Camelot launchpad had raised nearly **$38 million** across all projects, with a 100% record of public, community-accessible sales ([Camelot – Decentralized Launchpad for Early-Stage Token Access | CryptoRank.io](https://cryptorank.io/fundraising-platforms/camelot#:~:text=Image%3A%20Total%20Funds%20Raised%20Icon)). This has made Camelot one of the top decentralized launchpads on Arbitrum, often compared to centralized exchange launchpads in its ability to galvanize community investment. It’s worth noting Camelot does _not_ guarantee or certify the projects launched (it’s a neutral infrastructure), so participants assume normal DYOR risk ([Camelot – Decentralized Launchpad for Early-Stage Token Access | CryptoRank.io](https://cryptorank.io/fundraising-platforms/camelot#:~:text=While%20we%20support%20protocols%20that,tokens%20totally%20independent%20of%20Camelot)). However, many launchpad projects have been Round Table members, implying a degree of alignment and communication with Camelot’s team.

- **Multi-Chain Deployments:** In its **Orbital Liquidity Network** expansion, Camelot is now directly involved in new **Arbitrum Orbit chains**. By early 2025, Camelot had deployed its DEX contracts (AMMs, farms, etc.) on **eight Orbit chains** in addition to Arbitrum One ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20now%20the%20largest,65%20projects%20in%20the%20ecosystem)). These include chains such as **Sanko**, **XAI**, **Reya**, **Molten**, **EDU**, **WINR**, and others that are built with Arbitrum’s technology. Camelot’s presence on these chains means that when an Orbit chain launches, users can immediately trade that chain’s native tokens and bridged assets on a “Camelot DEX” instance, rather than needing to bootstrap a new DEX from scratch ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=With%20the%20expansion%20of%20Arbitrum,deployed%20on%208%20Orbit%20chains)). This is mutually beneficial: the new chain gains a trusted, liquid exchange, and Camelot extends GRAIL’s utility and fee-earning to additional networks. For example, **XAI** is an Orbit chain focusing on gaming (backed by Offchain Labs and game developers); Camelot on XAI provides trading for game tokens and connects liquidity back to Arbitrum One. Camelot’s plan is to **bridge liquidity across these deployments**, reducing fragmentation in the Arbitrum ecosystem ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=Becoming%20the%20Orbital%20Liquidity%20Network)) ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=Network%20Vision)). They are working on features to let users seamlessly bridge assets and even their LP positions between Camelot on different chains ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=This%20Orbital%20Liquidity%20Network%20encompasses,the%20broader%20Arbitrum%20ecosystem%27s%20growth)). Essentially, Camelot is becoming a network of DEXs with a shared token (GRAIL) and shared liquidity incentives. This places Camelot at the center of an _interconnected DeFi web_ spanning Arbitrum’s main chain and its satellites. It is a novel approach – while many DEXs go cross-chain, Camelot is specifically focusing on Arbitrum-related chains to maintain a unified ecosystem (leveraging the fact that Orbit chains inherit Arbitrum’s security). If Orbit chains proliferate (for gaming, social, or other purposes), Camelot’s multi-chain strategy could significantly enlarge its user base and volumes. Camelot has stated that value accrued on any Orbit instance of Camelot will flow back to GRAIL via fees, so GRAIL holders benefit from the whole network’s growth ([Introducing Camelot as the First Orbital Liquidity Network | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://medium.com/@camelotdex/introducing-camelot-as-the-first-orbital-liquidity-network-8434101bc6fd#:~:text=The%20GRAIL%20token%20has%20always,the%20rapid%20expansion%20across%20Orbit)).

In summary, Camelot’s ecosystem efforts – **partnering with dozens of projects, launching new tokens, and extending to new chains** – have made it more than just a single DEX. It operates as an infrastructure provider and launch ecosystem for Arbitrum. This is reinforced by Camelot’s community-driven style: its socials and documentation emphasize openness to all builders, permissionless access, and the idea of Camelot as a public good for Arbitrum DeFi. The protocol’s success is thus intertwined with the success of the many projects and chains building on Arbitrum.

## Tokenomics

**GRAIL Token:** Camelot’s native token **GRAIL** (sometimes called Camelot Token) is a scarce utility and governance token with a fixed maximum supply of **100,000 GRAIL** ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=fixing%20a%20%2420%20floor%20price,the%20first%20%24300k%20was%20raised)). It was introduced through the fair launch sale with no private allocation, and its distribution is designed to heavily favor community and long-term ecosystem incentives. The initial circulating supply at launch was low (only the public sale portion minus the xGRAIL escrow part), but the supply increases over time as various vested allocations unlock. Camelot’s documentation lays out the **GRAIL allocation** as follows ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=GRAIL%20allocation)) ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=%2A%2022.5,over%20the%20next%203%20years)):

- **15% – Public Sale** (fair launch auction in Nov 2022): _10%_ in liquid GRAIL + _5%_ in xGRAIL distributed to sale participants immediately ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=fixing%20a%20%2420%20floor%20price,the%20first%20%24300k%20was%20raised)). (xGRAIL from the sale still had to be vested or used in-platform, ensuring buyers had a long-term stake.)

- **10% – Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL):** GRAIL set aside to seed liquidity. 7.5% was pre-minted for the initial Camelot/USDC pool (as noted, Camelot paired 7,500 GRAIL with sale proceeds) ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=%2A%2015,GRAIL)). The remaining ~2.5% POL could be used for future liquidity needs or cross-chain deployments.

- **5% – Genesis Nitro Pools Rewards:** distributed as xGRAIL to early liquidity providers over the six months post-launch ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=%2A%2010,minted%20in%20a%20multisig)). This was the emissions for the Genesis farms (ended mid-2023).

- **22.5% – Liquidity Mining:** reserved for ongoing liquidity incentives (farm rewards) over approximately 3 years ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=%2A%2022.5,over%20the%20next%203%20years)). These emissions reward LPs on Camelot. Notably, Camelot’s emissions are paid out mostly in xGRAIL (escrowed) rather than pure GRAIL – roughly 85% of farming rewards are xGRAIL and 15% GRAIL ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=match%20at%20L246%20Camelot%20will,in%20xGRAIL)). This further encourages long-term alignment, as farmers accumulate locked tokens that yield revenue share.

- **20% – Core Contributors:** allocated to the Camelot team and core developers, vested linearly over 3 years ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=%2A%2022.5,over%20the%20next%203%20years)). This is effectively the “team allocation.” Again, a portion may be in xGRAIL form. The team’s tokens ensure the developers are incentivized to grow Camelot over time. (The **team remains pseudonymous**, but this allocation is transparently tracked via the Camelot multisig wallets ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=)) ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=,Incentives)).)

- **10% – Partnerships:** set aside for strategic partnerships and ecosystem programs, with a 6-month cliff and 2-year vesting ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=%2A%2020,vested%20linearly%20over%203%20years)). These tokens (likely distributed as xGRAIL) were intended to reward projects that integrate with Camelot and “ensure long-term alignment” ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=Partnerships)). Many initial Round Table partners received small allocations from this bucket, often to use in their own community incentives or to lock into Camelot for governance. (For example, a partner protocol might receive some xGRAIL and allocate it to boost their pool’s yield, benefiting their token liquidity.)

- **8% – Reserves:** held in reserve (pre-minted in a multisig) for unspecified future use ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=%2A%2020,vested%20linearly%20over%203%20years)). This might cover unforeseen needs, additional liquidity seeding, insurance, etc. Being pre-minted, these 8,000 GRAIL are out of circulation unless deployed.

- **5% – Ecosystem:** additional tokens earmarked for ecosystem growth (grants, marketing, community initiatives). This is a flexible allocation Camelot can use to fund programs that don’t neatly fall under partnerships or liquidity mining.

- **2.5% – Development Fund:** vested over 3 years, presumably to fund ongoing development, audits, and operational costs beyond the initial team allocation ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=%2A%2022.5,over%20the%20next%203%20years)). This might be managed by the Camelot DAO treasury or core team.

- **2% – Advisors:** vested over 3 years for any advisors of the project ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=%2A%205)). (It’s not publicly known who the advisors are – likely early contributors or industry experts who helped guide Camelot’s launch.)

All together, these allocations sum to 100%. Importantly, except for the reserves and dev fund, **most allocations emit as a mix of GRAIL and xGRAIL** – meaning even team, partnership, and farming tokens mostly come in the form of xGRAIL that must be converted to become liquid ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=%2A%202,linearly%20over%203%20years)). This throttles the rate at which GRAIL enters public circulation and ties the recipients to Camelot’s long-term success (since xGRAIL is productive if used in Camelot, but not tradeable externally). The **supply release schedule** was planned to be gradual, with liquidity mining and team tokens linearly releasing over 36 months from launch ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=%2A%2022.5,over%20the%20next%203%20years)). As of April 2025 (about 2.5 years from launch), GRAIL’s circulating supply remains well below the 100k cap, as a significant portion is still vested or locked as xGRAIL.

Economically, GRAIL is intended to **capture the value generated by Camelot**. It does so through multiple mechanisms: (1) **Protocol fee accrual:** A percentage of all trading fees is used to market-buy GRAIL and then **burn** it (permanently removing it) – originally 12.5% of fees on v2 pools ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=V2)), with analogous but smaller percentages on v3 pools post-upgrade. This creates constant buy pressure and deflates supply as Camelot’s volume grows. (2) **Real yield to xGRAIL:** Another cut of fees is distributed to xGRAIL stakers as rewards (in the form of the traded tokens), functioning like dividends to GRAIL holders ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=V2)) ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=%2A%2085,in%20LP%20tokens)). This gives GRAIL a yield backed by actual trading activity (fees from swaps, and even performance fees from managed vaults ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=V3%20vaults))). (3) **Governance and utility:** GRAIL (via xGRAIL) influences Camelot’s governance and incentive allocations. Although Camelot’s governance is still evolving, xGRAIL holders can vote on certain protocol decisions and direct liquidity incentives using their staked weight, similar to a vote-escrow model. This control over the protocol’s future adds an intrinsic value to holding GRAIL for those who believe in steering Camelot’s direction.

**xGRAIL Token:** **xGRAIL** is the _escrowed_ version of GRAIL and is central to Camelot’s tokenomics. When a user stakes GRAIL, they receive xGRAIL, which is **non-transferable** and represents staked interest in Camelot ([┃xGRAIL Token | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/xgrail-token#:~:text=Name%3A%20Camelot%20Escrowed%20Token%20Ticker%3A,xGRAIL%20Chain%3A%20Arbitrum%20Contract)). xGRAIL does not have a market price (since it can’t be traded), but it can be converted back to GRAIL by unstaking (either via a time-based unlock or by paying an early exit fee). Importantly, xGRAIL is **not just a passive receipt token** – it’s meant to be put to work through Camelot’s plugin system. Users holding xGRAIL can allocate it into one or more **xGRAIL Plugins** to receive different benefits ([┃xGRAIL Token | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/xgrail-token#:~:text=xGRAIL%20is%20a%20non,or%20through%20direct%20GRAIL%20conversion)) ([┃xGRAIL Token | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/xgrail-token#:~:text=The%20central%20use%20case%20for,in%20exchange%20for%20various%20benefits)):

- _Real Yield Staking:_ By allocating xGRAIL to the **Real Yield** plugin, the user earns a share of Camelot’s protocol earnings. Camelot pools a portion of all swap fees (and other revenues like launchpad fees) into a dividend fund which is periodically distributed to those who have staked xGRAIL in this plugin. The rewards are paid in the tokens collected (e.g. ETH, USDC, etc.), giving xGRAIL holders exposure to diversified fee income ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=Camelot%20also%20receives%20a%20portion,of%20the%20total%2C%20split%20between)) ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=7,through%20%20plugin)). This effectively turns GRAIL into a revenue-sharing token – as Camelot’s trading volume increases, the payouts to xGRAIL stakers increase. This “real yield” mechanism has been a major selling point of Camelot, aligning it with the trend of DeFi protocols that generate sustainable yields from fees (rather than inflation).

- _Yield Booster:_ The **Yield Booster plugin** allows xGRAIL to be used to boost liquidity mining rewards. An LP who is farming on Camelot can stake a certain amount of xGRAIL and assign it to their farm position, which grants a multiplier on the rewards they earn ([Camelot welcomes Factor to the Round Table | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-welcomes-factor-to-the-round-table-34fb994c3d5f#:~:text=,capture%20real%20yield%20for%20holders)) ([Camelot welcomes Factor to the Round Table | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-welcomes-factor-to-the-round-table-34fb994c3d5f#:~:text=Camelot%20will%20leverage%20all%20its,deposit%20over%20a%20certain%20amount)). For example, providing liquidity to a volatile token pair might normally earn 50% APR in GRAIL/xGRAIL, but by committing xGRAIL to the Yield Booster, a user could increase their APR to say 80%, depending on how much xGRAIL they allocate. This mechanism incentivizes larger and longer-term liquidity providers to also become GRAIL holders (since to maximize yield, one must hold xGRAIL). It also lets projects direct more rewards to “sticky” liquidity: Camelot’s Nitro pools could be configured such that only LPs who lock liquidity and apply xGRAIL boosts get the extra partner token rewards ([Camelot welcomes Factor to the Round Table | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-welcomes-factor-to-the-round-table-34fb994c3d5f#:~:text=,capture%20real%20yield%20for%20holders)) ([Camelot welcomes Factor to the Round Table | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-welcomes-factor-to-the-round-table-34fb994c3d5f#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20we%20could%20set,that%20benefits%20the%20entire%20ecosystem)). The result is a more efficient use of incentive budget – rewarding the most committed liquidity providers.

- _Community & Governance Plugins:_ Camelot has envisioned other plugins that xGRAIL can be used for, including ones tied to governance and partner project benefits ([┃xGRAIL Token | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/xgrail-token#:~:text=)) ([┃xGRAIL Token | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/xgrail-token#:~:text=,Yield%20Booster)). For instance, Camelot could introduce an **IDO allocation plugin** where staking xGRAIL grants access to guaranteed allocations in launchpad sales. Another example is using xGRAIL for governance votes (either in Camelot’s own future DAO or in partner protocols’ gauges). Some partner protocols have created incentives for xGRAIL holders – e.g., a project could require holding xGRAIL to join a special yield pool or to get whitelist access to their NFT drop, etc. While these are optional programs, they reinforce xGRAIL’s position as a **multifaceted utility token** in the Arbitrum ecosystem.

By dividing GRAIL’s roles in two (liquid vs. escrowed), Camelot achieves a kind of **balanced tokenomics**: GRAIL provides market liquidity and price discovery, while xGRAIL provides stability and reward utility. Holders who believe in Camelot’s long-term value will naturally convert to xGRAIL to get rewards, while those who need liquidity will hold/swap GRAIL. As of 2025, a significant portion of GRAIL supply remains in the form of xGRAIL, indicating strong long-term conviction among the community (especially since early farming rewards and partner allocations were issued as xGRAIL). The protocol regularly reports on the amount of GRAIL bought back and burned, and the yields paid to xGRAIL stakers, to demonstrate the health of the ecosystem. In summary, Camelot’s tokenomics emphasize **fair distribution, gradual emissions, real yield, and incentive alignment**, aiming to avoid the pitfalls of inflationary farm-and-dump schemes seen in earlier DEXs.

## Team and Governance

Camelot’s team began as a **small, pseudonymous collective of DeFi builders**, with no large corporate backers. The project’s founder is known by the alias **“Myrddin”** (a reference to Merlin of Arthurian legend) ([Arbitrum-Based Camelot Crypto Exchange to Deploy V2 Upgrade Saturday](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/07/arbitrum-based-camelot-crypto-exchange-to-deploy-v2-upgrade-saturday#:~:text=The%20upgrade%20will%20launch%20in,the%20rebasing%20tokens%20like%20stETH)), who was instrumental in designing Camelot’s protocol and often represents Camelot in community forums. Other core contributors have used handles such as **“Sphinx”** and **“0xNinjas”** in community chats, though detailed information about the individuals is scarce (a deliberate choice, as Camelot focused on community ownership and fair launch ethos). This pseudonymity is common in DeFi, and the team has built credibility through delivery: since launch, they have consistently rolled out new features and responded to community feedback.

Despite being pseudonymous, the Camelot team has been transparent about the protocol’s finances and operations. The **Core Contributors allocation (20% of GRAIL)** is managed via multi-signature wallets whose addresses are public ([⚖️┃Token distribution | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/token-distribution#:~:text=,%E2%94%83Incentive%20system)) ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=)). The team also engaged trusted auditors (such as Paladin Blockchain Security) to audit Camelot’s smart contracts before launch ([Audits | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/references/audits#:~:text=Audits%20,pdf)). Camelot’s documentation provides information on multisig signers and security measures, indicating a focus on community trust.

In terms of governance, Camelot initially operated with a _founding team led_ model, but with a strong community influence. Major changes (like introducing new plugins or chain deployments) are often discussed openly in Camelot’s Discord or forums. Camelot has a **native governance token (xGRAIL)**, and while formal DAO governance was limited in the first year, the long-term intent is to move towards community voting on proposals. For example, Camelot’s **fee parameters and emissions** could eventually be governed by xGRAIL votes. There is also an established **Camelot DAO Treasury** (funded by a portion of protocol fees and the 5% Ecosystem allocation) which is expected to come under community governance. As of 2025, some governance processes are already in place: xGRAIL holders can vote on certain **liquidity gauge weights** (deciding which farms get higher rewards) – a model inspired by Curve’s vote-escrow system, aligning governance with value generated.

Camelot also participates in broader Arbitrum governance. Notably, Camelot was the recipient of an Arbitrum DAO airdrop in March 2023 (when Arbitrum distributed ARB tokens to early projects). Camelot received a substantial ARB allocation, which it held for use in ecosystem initiatives. In mid-2023, Camelot (through founder Myrddin and others) proposed an **Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP)** to secure additional ARB tokens as liquidity mining incentives for Arbitrum-native projects ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=the%20community%20aspect%20of%20Arbitrum,L1)). This was a bold governance move, effectively asking the Arbitrum community to invest in Camelot’s strategy of seeding new projects. While the initial proposal met mixed feedback and wasn’t approved in original form, it demonstrated Camelot’s proactive approach to governance beyond its own platform – acting as a voice for smaller projects in the Arbitrum DAO. Camelot has since adjusted its request and continues to work with the Arbitrum Foundation on potential collaboration (for example, more modest incentive programs that the DAO might fund).

The **team’s philosophy** is often stated as _“community first, builders first.”_ They remained without salary until the public raise (using 20% of raise proceeds to fund the team’s work) ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=The%20public%20sale%20proceeds%20were,directed%20as%20follows)). The success of Camelot is closely tied to the dedication of its core contributors, who have kept an aggressive development schedule – launching v3, v4, new incentives, and multi-chain support all within about a year. As the project matures, it is likely to formalize its governance (potentially transitioning to a DAO where xGRAIL holders vote on proposals). The **Camelot Job Board** ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=,20)) indicates the team is expanding, recruiting talent to further develop the protocol across Solidity engineering, frontend, and business development, which also suggests a gradual de-pseudonymization as they onboard new members.

In summary, Camelot’s team remains semi-anonymous but has proven reliable and community-oriented. Governance is progressively decentralizing, with xGRAIL at the center of future decision-making. Camelot’s trajectory from a lean, bootstrapped team to a major infrastructure provider in Arbitrum showcases the strength of its community-driven approach.

## Partnerships and Collaborations

Camelot has forged numerous partnerships, reflecting its role as an ecosystem hub. Some of the **major collaborations** and their significance include:

- **Arbitrum & Offchain Labs:** While not an official product of Offchain Labs, Camelot is closely aligned with Arbitrum’s ecosystem goals. Offchain Labs supported Camelot indirectly by awarding it ARB tokens during the Arbitrum airdrop (recognizing Camelot as a key protocol on Arbitrum). The introduction of Arbitrum Orbit chains created a natural partnership: Camelot committed to deploy on Orbit chains, effectively enhancing Arbitrum’s offering to new projects (anyone launching an Orbit chain knows Camelot can provide an out-of-the-box DEX). Offchain Labs in turn has acknowledged Camelot’s contributions in fostering adoption on Arbitrum. This symbiosis can be seen in Camelot’s promotional materials calling itself “deeply aligned with the Arbitrum ecosystem” ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=,highly%20efficient%20spot%20liquidity%20infrastructure)) ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=,traders%2C%20and%20the%20broader%20community)). While Camelot’s AIP for ARB incentives was not greenlit in full, it opened dialogue – the Arbitrum Foundation could collaborate with Camelot on more targeted initiatives (for example, co-sponsoring yield incentives for critical infrastructure projects). In effect, Camelot serves as a **community extension of Arbitrum**, accelerating ecosystem growth in ways the core team at Offchain Labs might not directly handle.

- **Algebra (DEX Technology Provider):** A crucial technical partnership is with **Algebra Finance**, the developers of the concentrated liquidity engine that Camelot uses for AMM v3 and v4. Instead of writing a custom AMM from scratch, Camelot leveraged Algebra’s audited, feature-rich code ([Camelot V2 — Concentrated Liquidity, UI overhaul & High-Efficiency Farms | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-v2-concentrated-liquidity-ui-overhaul-high-efficiency-farms-5e22e53dff87#:~:text=Instead%20of%20spending%20significant%20time,and%20the%20broader%20Arbitrum%20ecosystem)). The relationship is mutually beneficial: Camelot gets cutting-edge AMM functionality (like dynamic fees, adjustable tick spacing), and Algebra showcases its technology on a large production platform. In April 2025, Algebra even published a case study highlighting Camelot’s success using Algebra’s CLAMM (Concentrated Liquidity AMM) – noting that **Camelot V3 powered by Algebra achieved 8.6× higher fee efficiency per TVL** than Camelot’s earlier AMM ([Algebra & Camelot: The Future of DEX Performance on Arbitrum & Orbit Chains | by Algebra | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@crypto_algebra/algebra-camelot-the-future-of-dex-performance-on-arbitrum-orbit-chains-d29078db96b8#:~:text=Let%E2%80%99s%20compare%20the%20performance%20of,highlight%20the%20differences%20in%20efficiency)) ([Algebra & Camelot: The Future of DEX Performance on Arbitrum & Orbit Chains | by Algebra | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@crypto_algebra/algebra-camelot-the-future-of-dex-performance-on-arbitrum-orbit-chains-d29078db96b8#:~:text=Camelot%20V3%3A)). Camelot’s AMM v4 “Integral” is based on Algebra’s newer version, and Algebra developers likely worked closely with Camelot to implement and test the plugin architecture in a real-world setting ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=Camelot%20integrates%20the%201,for%20traders%20and%20liquidity%20providers)) ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=,enhanced%20functionality%20for%20the%20protocol)). Algebra receives a small licensing fee from Camelot (the docs mention 1.5% of certain vault fees going to Algebra ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=22.5,through%20%20plugin))), formalizing the partnership. This collaboration ensures Camelot stays technically competitive with larger DEXs (like Uniswap v3), by integrating new features from Algebra’s roadmap. It also means Camelot can focus on ecosystem and product integration, while Algebra focuses on core AMM innovation – a classic win-win specialization.

- **Gamma Strategies:** Camelot partnered with **Gamma Strategies**, a DeFi firm specializing in active liquidity management (they create vaults that automate Uniswap v3 position adjustments). In Camelot’s context, Gamma provided **managed vaults for Camelot’s concentrated pools** in 2023, helping users who didn’t want to manually adjust their liquidity ranges. Camelot’s docs note that Camelot takes a portion of Gamma’s performance fees as well ([┃Protocol earnings | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/tokenomics/protocol-earnings#:~:text=V3%20vaults)) – indicating a formal agreement. Through Gamma, Camelot offered “Vaults” where LPs could deposit and have Gamma optimize their position for them, earning passive fees. This was valuable especially in early days of V3 when many Camelot users were unfamiliar with concentrated liquidity. The Gamma partnership essentially added an _automated LP service_ on top of Camelot, improving user experience. Now, with Camelot’s own incentive system and upcoming automated strategies, the reliance on Gamma may lessen, but in 2023 it was an important bridge technology for onboarding liquidity. Gamma, in return, gained exposure and a revenue share on Arbitrum’s largest DEX. The collaboration exemplified Camelot’s openness to integrating third-party services for the benefit of users.

- **Round Table Protocols:** Beyond formal tech partners, Camelot’s collaborations with **Round Table member projects** have been pivotal. For instance, Camelot worked with **Yield Protocol/Pendle** to host Pendle’s Arbitrum liquidity – Pendle’s yield-bearing tokens needed AMM liquidity, and Camelot provided stable pools and incentives, which Pendle augmented with its own rewards. **Hop Protocol**, an L2 bridge, partnered with Camelot to deepen liquidity for bridged assets on Arbitrum (Hop incentives combined with Camelot Nitro meant users could earn both HOP and GRAIL rewards for providing liquidity to Hop’s bridged tokens). **Plutus DAO** (a governance aggregator on Arbitrum) collaborated with Camelot when launching its products like Plutus Vaults and Arbitrove – Plutus used Camelot for initial liquidity and in turn locked some of its treasury as xGRAIL to support Camelot’s governance, aligning the two communities. **Lyra** (an options protocol) integrated Camelot to swap its LYRA rewards into stablecoins on Arbitrum, benefiting from Camelot’s liquidity. Each of these partnerships was often announced publicly (Medium posts or Twitter) and came with cross-promotional benefits. Camelot would frequently tweet about partner milestones, and partners likewise promoted Camelot as their DEX of choice. Such collaborations strengthen the **network effects** – users of one protocol are introduced to Camelot and vice versa. It also aids **composability**: for example, if a user earns rewards on Camelot, they might stake them in a partner protocol’s vault, creating an interconnected DeFi experience.

- **Exchanges and Integrations:** Over time, Camelot’s GRAIL and xGRAIL have been integrated into various services. Several **centralized exchanges** listed GRAIL (due to high demand during its price rally in early 2023), increasing its accessibility. Analytics platforms like DeFiLlama and Dune Analytics integrated Camelot’s data, and wallets (e.g. Rainbow, Zerion) added support for Camelot pools and assets ([Camelot overview - Token Terminal](https://tokenterminal.com/explorer/projects/camelot#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20a%20non,Myrddin%20and%20launched%20in%202022)). Camelot’s own front-end features integration with tools like **GeckoTerminal** and **CoinGecko** for price tracking ([The Round Table - Camelot DEX](https://app.camelot.exchange/protocols/lexer#:~:text=The%20Round%20Table%20,%C2%B7%20Bridge%20%C2%B7%20CoinGecko)). On the backend, Camelot’s smart contracts interact with **Arbitrum’s official bridge** contracts for cross-chain transfers and will likely integrate **LayerZero or Wormhole** for Orbit chain bridging in the future (as hinted by their network vision). While not a traditional partnership, Camelot’s cooperation with these infrastructure players ensures users can move funds in and out and track their investments easily.

- **Media and Community Partners:** Camelot has also partnered with community educators and media (for instance, _Arbitrum News DAO_ or _DeFi education blogs_) to produce explainers and AMAs about Camelot. These help demystify Camelot’s complex mechanics (like xGRAIL plugins or Nitro pools) for the general audience. The **Everipedia/IQ Wiki** entry for Camelot ([Camelot DEX - Exchanges | IQ.wiki](https://iq.wiki/wiki/camelot-dex#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20a%20decentralized%20exchange,2)) is an example of community-driven documentation that Camelot supported – it compiles information and cites sources that were likely provided or verified by Camelot team members. Additionally, Camelot’s team appears in joint AMAs on Telegram or YouTube with partner projects, demonstrating a collaborative marketing approach.

Overall, Camelot’s partnerships span **technology, liquidity, and outreach**. By integrating an advanced AMM from Algebra, working hand-in-hand with dozens of Arbitrum protocols, and aligning with Arbitrum’s multi-chain vision, Camelot has embedded itself into the fabric of the ecosystem. Each collaboration has reinforced Camelot’s core mission: to be a **custom-built liquidity hub for Arbitrum** that “encourages cross-pollination” among projects ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=Besides%20this%20,all%20the%20Arbitrum%20native%20protocols)). This strategy has not only benefited Camelot (in terms of volume and TVL growth) but also helped Arbitrum’s ecosystem flourish with a reliable DEX backbone.

## Notable Events and Milestones

Camelot’s journey has been marked by several significant events and announcements:

- **November 2022 – Fair Launch and Genesis:** Camelot conducted its **public token sale from Nov 29 to Dec 5, 2022**, raising ~$3.8 million and pricing GRAIL at $254 ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=)). Immediately after, the team launched **Genesis farms (Nov 2022 – May 2023)** which distributed xGRAIL to early LPs ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=,to%20depositors%20from%20November%2023rd)). These early steps set Camelot’s community-driven tone (no private sales, no VC). The **Camelot DEX went live** in early December 2022 on Arbitrum One, with initial pools and the GRAIL/USDC pair seeded by the protocol ([┃Launch & Genesis | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/launch-and-genesis#:~:text=)).

- **Q1 2023 – Rapid Growth and Partnerships:** In the first quarter of 2023, Camelot’s usage exploded. By **March 2023**, Camelot reached over **$100M TVL and ~$18M in 24h trading volume**, riding the wave of Arbitrum’s popularity ([Arbitrum-Based Camelot Crypto Exchange to Deploy V2 Upgrade Saturday](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/07/arbitrum-based-camelot-crypto-exchange-to-deploy-v2-upgrade-saturday#:~:text=CoinGecko%20data,15%20at%20press%20time)). Many **Round Table partnerships** were formalized during this time, and Camelot hosted high-profile token launches (e.g. Vela in Jan, Factor in Feb 2023). On **March 23, 2023**, Arbitrum airdropped ARB tokens to Camelot’s DAO treasury (Camelot received a notable allocation as one of Arbitrum’s top projects). Camelot announced plans to use these ARB for liquidity incentives, foreshadowing later governance proposals.

- **April 2023 – “V2” Upgrade (Concentrated Liquidity):** On **April 8, 2023**, Camelot deployed its concentrated liquidity AMM (Algebra-based) in a **v2 platform upgrade** ([Arbitrum-Based Camelot Crypto Exchange to Deploy V2 Upgrade Saturday](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/07/arbitrum-based-camelot-crypto-exchange-to-deploy-v2-upgrade-saturday#:~:text=The%20upgrade%20will%20launch%20in,the%20rebasing%20tokens%20like%20stETH)). This was a major technical milestone, improving capital efficiency. The rollout came in stages (AMM launch, then UI overhaul, then new farms) ([Camelot V2 — Concentrated Liquidity, UI overhaul & High-Efficiency Farms | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelot-v2-concentrated-liquidity-ui-overhaul-high-efficiency-farms-5e22e53dff87#:~:text=V2%20will%20launch%20in%20three,deployed%20on%20Saturday%208th%2C%20April)) and was completed by May 2023. Coinciding with this, GRAIL hit an all-time high price (over $4,000 in early April) amid excitement for the upgrade, though it corrected afterwards in volatile trading. Coindesk and other outlets covered the upgrade, quoting founder Myrddin on its significance ([Arbitrum-Based Camelot Crypto Exchange to Deploy V2 Upgrade Saturday](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/07/arbitrum-based-camelot-crypto-exchange-to-deploy-v2-upgrade-saturday#:~:text=The%20upgrade%20will%20launch%20in,the%20rebasing%20tokens%20like%20stETH)) ([Arbitrum-Based Camelot Crypto Exchange to Deploy V2 Upgrade Saturday](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/07/arbitrum-based-camelot-crypto-exchange-to-deploy-v2-upgrade-saturday#:~:text=automated%20market%20maker%20,the%20rebasing%20tokens%20like%20stETH)). This event marked Camelot’s transition from a simple UniV2 fork into a technologically sophisticated DEX.

- **Mid-2023 – Governance Proposal and Market Dynamics:** In **July 2023**, Camelot submitted an **Arbitrum DAO proposal (“Accelerating Arbitrum”)** seeking **1.5M ARB per month** for 6 months to fund Camelot-based liquidity incentives for new projects ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=the%20community%20aspect%20of%20Arbitrum,L1)). The proposal sparked extensive discussion on the Arbitrum forum and Crypto Twitter. Although many acknowledged Camelot’s contributions (noting its innovations like Nitro Pools and directional fees ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=the%20community%20aspect%20of%20Arbitrum,L1))), others were concerned about the ask size and Camelot’s UI shortcomings ([Proposal: Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders - Page 10 - Finalized AIPs - Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116?page=10#:~:text=banterltyics%20%20July%2010%2C%202023%2C,12%3A36pm%20%20199)). The proposal was ultimately not approved in that form. However, it was a landmark in Camelot’s history as it showed Camelot taking initiative in L2 governance and rallying ecosystem projects in support. In the market, **March–July 2023 saw GRAIL’s price and Camelot’s TVL fluctuate**: after the early peak, GRAIL stabilized in the $1,000–$2,000 range. Camelot’s trading volume remained strong, though competing DEXs (like Sushi’s Arbitrum deployment and new entrants) began to chase its market share. Camelot responded by continually adding partner incentives and emphasizing “real yield” to retain liquidity.

- **August 2023 – $30B Volume Milestone:** Camelot quietly surpassed **$30 billion in cumulative trading volume** on Arbitrum around summer 2023 ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20a%20decentralized%20and,diverse%20and%20expansive%20Arbitrum%20ecosystem)), a testament to the active trading on its platform (especially during the ARB airdrop frenzy and subsequent volatility). This milestone, achieved in under a year of launch, underscored Camelot’s status as a top DEX on Arbitrum. By comparison, it took some DEXs on Ethereum a longer time to reach similar volumes, highlighting Arbitrum’s rapid growth and Camelot’s pivotal role in it.

- **Late 2023 – Multi-Chain Deployments Begin:** After Arbitrum Orbit was announced, Camelot started deploying on testnet and early mainnet Orbit chains. The first live deployment was likely on **Nova** (Arbitrum’s sidechain) or an Orbit demo chain in late 2023, followed by others. By **Q4 2023**, Camelot was running on at least a few Orbit chains (names like **Molten** and **Superposition** appear in Camelot’s docs as deployed networks ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=,Reya)) ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=))). Each deployment was an event for that chain’s community. For example, when **WINR (a gaming chain)** launched, Camelot deployment meant WINR’s token and in-game tokens immediately had liquidity. While each single-chain volume was modest at start, these deployments planted seeds for Camelot’s cross-chain network.

- **Aug 28, 2024 – Orbital Liquidity Network Announcement:** Camelot published a comprehensive **Medium article introducing its “Orbital Liquidity Network” vision** ([Introducing Camelot as the First Orbital Liquidity Network | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://medium.com/@camelotdex/introducing-camelot-as-the-first-orbital-liquidity-network-8434101bc6fd#:~:text=Initial%20Foundations)) ([Introducing Camelot as the First Orbital Liquidity Network | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://medium.com/@camelotdex/introducing-camelot-as-the-first-orbital-liquidity-network-8434101bc6fd#:~:text=is%20a%20natural%20evolution%2C%20with,of%20the%20core%20Camelot%20vision)). In it, Camelot recapped its first-year achievements (75+ partners, $27M+ fees, etc.) and unveiled a rebrand with new visuals and roadmap. The team announced that Camelot was active on 4+ Orbit chains and would aggressively pursue more, aiming to be the hub connecting them. They also teased a possible **GRAIL token split** in the future to accommodate cross-chain utility ([Introducing Camelot as the First Orbital Liquidity Network | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://medium.com/@camelotdex/introducing-camelot-as-the-first-orbital-liquidity-network-8434101bc6fd#:~:text=The%20GRAIL%20token%20has%20always,the%20rapid%20expansion%20across%20Orbit)). This announcement was essentially Camelot’s “Version 2.0” vision statement for the protocol’s next phase. The news was well-received, as it aligned with broader industry trends of modular blockchains and showed Camelot’s commitment to innovation. The GRAIL token saw a positive bump on the day of the announcement, reflecting investor confidence in the expansion plan. The piece also introduced Camelot’s updated **“Castle” branding**, unifying the imagery across mainnet and Orbit deployments.

- **Dec 2024 – New Incentive System Beta:** On **December 2, 2024**, Camelot launched the beta of its new **modular liquidity incentive system** ([Camelot’s new modular system beta launch | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelots-new-modular-system-beta-launch-1fac50ea9e32#:~:text=Context)) ([Camelot’s new modular system beta launch | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelots-new-modular-system-beta-launch-1fac50ea9e32#:~:text=The%20new%20incentive%20system%20has,in%20whatever%20way%20they%20choose)). This replaced the older Nitro Pools and third-party solutions for v3 with a Camelot-built solution covering all AMMs. The system allowed protocols to permissionlessly create customized “campaigns” to reward LPs, with features like epoch-based reward calculations, whitelists/blacklists for certain LP types, and multi-token rewards ([Camelot’s new modular system beta launch | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelots-new-modular-system-beta-launch-1fac50ea9e32#:~:text=Key%20features)) ([Camelot’s new modular system beta launch | by Camelot DEX | Medium](https://camelotdex.medium.com/camelots-new-modular-system-beta-launch-1fac50ea9e32#:~:text=,from%20the%20distributor%20contract%20at)). The rollout was significant for Camelot’s many partners: over a dozen projects migrated their liquidity incentives to the new system. For example, Protocol A could now easily set up a campaign on Camelot to distribute its token to LPs who provide liquidity in a specific range for 30 days, etc., all through a user-friendly interface. The beta period (Dec 2024 – Jan 2025) was used to fine-tune the parameters. This event demonstrated Camelot’s focus on _developer experience_ for partners, not just user experience – by making liquidity mining easier to manage, Camelot strengthened its position as the go-to place for Arbitrum projects to bootstrap liquidity. It also coincided with the tail end of Camelot’s AMM v4 testing, meaning by early 2025 the stage was set for a full transition to the new architecture.

- **Early 2025 – AMM V4 Full Launch:** In the first quarter of 2025, Camelot’s AMM V4 (Algebra Integral) completed its beta and was rolled out on Arbitrum One and relevant Orbit chains. This gave the green light for **plugin features** to be widely used in pools. One of the first observed uses was an **Adaptive Fee plugin** enabled on a volatile pair, showing fees automatically adjusting to market conditions. Camelot’s documentation was updated (last updated ~Feb 2025) to reflect V4 being live ([┃AMM V4 | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/amm-v4#:~:text=Last%20updated%202%20months%20ago)). By consolidating the new AMM and incentive system, Camelot entered 2025 with a robust infrastructure. In community calls, the team hinted at turning on **governance features** next – possibly letting xGRAIL holders vote on plugin configurations or new chain deployments.

- **April 2025 – Ecosystem Status:** As of April 2025, Camelot has entrenched itself as a key player in Arbitrum’s DeFi landscape. The **Camelot DEX on Arbitrum One remains the chain’s largest native DEX by volume and liquidity** ([┃Overview | Camelot DEX](https://docs.camelot.exchange/#:~:text=Camelot%20is%20a%20decentralized%20and,diverse%20and%20expansive%20Arbitrum%20ecosystem)), even as competition persists from Sushi, Uniswap, and others. GRAIL’s market capitalization, while much smaller than UNI or SUSHI, is buoyed by the relatively low supply and strong protocol earnings (over **$52M in fees accumulated** to date) ([Algebra & Camelot: The Future of DEX Performance on Arbitrum & Orbit Chains | by Algebra | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@crypto_algebra/algebra-camelot-the-future-of-dex-performance-on-arbitrum-orbit-chains-d29078db96b8#:~:text=partners%2C%20generating%20,to%20be%20a%20decentralized%20exchange)). Hundreds of users stake xGRAIL to earn a share of daily fees, and Camelot regularly reports the GRAIL buyback burns (for instance, millions of dollars worth of GRAIL have been bought and burned over the past year, gradually shrinking supply). Camelot’s launchpad has slowed in terms of number of new sales (the 2024 bear market saw fewer big launches), but a few Orbit chain tokens were distributed via Camelot, and the pipeline may pick up with market conditions. In April 2025, Camelot was also preparing for Arbitrum’s upcoming **Stylus upgrade** (which allows Rust and C++ contracts) – the team expressed interest in leveraging Stylus to optimize some contracts and perhaps launch a general-purpose Camelot Orbit chain for protocol operations.

In conclusion, Camelot’s story from late 2022 to April 2025 is one of rapid growth, continuous innovation, and deepening integration in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Its notable events reflect a project that quickly went from a fair launch experiment to an indispensable piece of infrastructure. Camelot has navigated the challenges of sustaining a DeFi protocol through both bull and bear market phases, using a strong community focus and technical improvements to remain relevant. The “Camelot” brand – once just an Arthurian-themed DEX – now stands for a broader network of exchanges and launchpads fueling Arbitrum’s expansion. As new Layer-2 networks proliferate, Camelot’s approach may serve as a blueprint for community-driven protocols aiming to bootstrap entire ecosystems.
