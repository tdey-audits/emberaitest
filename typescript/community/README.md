### üöÄ Running Community Agents

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most agents in this directory use the older Vibekit architecture. For new agent development, always use the [templates directory](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript/templates) as your reference.The templates showcase the latest framework features including skills, tools, hooks, and LLM orchestration.

Each agent has its own setup and configuration requirements. To run a specific agent, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in its README file.

### üõ†Ô∏è Building Your Own Agent

To build a custom agent for the community:

1. **Start with `quickstart-agent`**: Use the [`quickstart-agent`](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript/templates/quickstart-agent) template as your foundation. It demonstrates all v2 framework features.

2. **Follow the Template Guide**: See the [templates README](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/typescript/templates/README.md) for step-by-step instructions on creating agents.

3. **Review Architecture Docs**: Check out the [lesson series](https://github.com/EmberAGI/arbitrum-vibekit/tree/main/docs) for comprehensive framework documentation.

4. **Submit Your Agent**: Once your agent is ready, create a pull request to add it to this community directory. Make sure to include:
   - Comprehensive README with setup instructions
   - `.env.example` file with required configuration
   - Tests demonstrating functionality
   - Clear documentation of capabilities
