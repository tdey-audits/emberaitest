Q6: Are admin controls documented?
Weight: 8%

Purpose: Evaluate whether the protocol clearly documents what administrative controls exist, who controls them, and what powers they have. This is crucial for understanding centralization risks and trust assumptions.

Where to Look: Search for "Admin", "Governance", "Permissions", "Roles", or "Access Control" in documentation. Look for explanations of what can be changed and by whom.

Scoring Criteria: Simplified evaluation of admin control documentation:

    100% (Full marks): Admin controls are documented anywhere in the documentation, whether comprehensive or with some missing details. Any mention of admin functions, governance, or control mechanisms qualifies.

    40%: Basic mention of admin controls without comprehensive details - perhaps just a passing reference without explanation.

    0%: No documentation of admin controls whatsoever.

Answer Format: The answer should state whether admin controls are documented and provide the resulting score. For example:

    "Yes – the documentation describes admin controls and governance mechanisms. Score: 100%."

If minimal information:

    "Admin controls are briefly mentioned but lack detail. Score: 40%."

If no information:

    "No – the documentation does not describe any admin controls. Score: 0%."

Each statement should be backed by a citation from the documentation where the information (or lack thereof) was confirmed.
