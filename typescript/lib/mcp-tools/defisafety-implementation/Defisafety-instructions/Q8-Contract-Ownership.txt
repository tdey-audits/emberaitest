Q8: Is contract ownership documented?
Weight: 7%

Purpose: Verify that the protocol documents who owns the contracts, whether ownership is renounced, transferred to a DAO, or held by team members. This affects the trust model and decentralization.

Where to Look: Search for "Ownership", "Contract Owner", "Decentralization", or governance documentation in the official documentation only. Note: We only evaluate based on documentation, not code analysis.

Scoring Criteria: Simplified evaluation based only on documentation:

    100% (Full marks): Documentation mentions contract ownership in any form - whether describing ownership structure, renunciation, or governance control.

    40%: Ownership information found in external sources but not in official documentation.

    0%: No documentation about contract ownership found.

Answer Format: The answer should state whether contract ownership is documented and provide the resulting score. For example:

    "Yes – the documentation mentions contract ownership structure. Score: 100%."

If found externally:

    "Ownership information found in external sources but not in official docs. Score: 40%."

If no information:

    "No – the documentation does not mention contract ownership. Score: 0%."

Each statement should be backed by a citation from the documentation where the information (or lack thereof) was confirmed.
