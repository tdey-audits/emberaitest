DeFiSafety Scoring Rubric - Simplified Version
==============================================

Question Weights (Total: 100%)
------------------------------
Q1: Contract Addresses         - 15%
Q2: Public Repository          - 5%
Q3: Whitepaper                 - 5%
Q4: Architecture               - 12%
Q5: Bug Bounty                 - 8%
Q6: Admin Controls             - 8%
Q7: Upgradeability             - 10%
Q8: Contract Ownership         - 7%
Q9: Change Capabilities        - 12%
Q10: Oracle Documentation      - 12%
--------------------------------------
TOTAL:                          100%

Scoring Bands
-------------
90-100%: Excellent - Very strong documentation and transparency
70-89%:  Good - Well documented with minor gaps
50-69%:  Adequate - Acceptable documentation with notable gaps
30-49%:  Poor - Significant documentation deficiencies
0-29%:   Failing - Critical lack of documentation and transparency

Score Calculation
-----------------
Final Score = Σ(Question Score × Question Weight)

For example:
- Q1 scores 100% with 15% weight = 15 points
- Q2 scores 70% with 5% weight = 3.5 points
- etc.

The final score is the sum of all weighted scores.

Important Notes
---------------
1. Scoring has been simplified to be more lenient than original DeFiSafety criteria
2. Q5 (Testing) has been removed as test-to-code ratio is not implemented
3. Contract ownership evaluation is based only on documentation, not code analysis
4. For Q1, Q6, Q7, Q8: 70% and 100% scores are merged into 100% for simplicity
5. All evaluations are based on publicly available documentation only

Minimum Acceptable Score
------------------------
Projects should aim for at least 50% to be considered adequately documented.
A score below 30% indicates serious transparency and documentation issues that should be addressed immediately.
