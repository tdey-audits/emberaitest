Q7: Is the upgradeability of contracts documented?
Weight: 10%

Purpose: Determine if the protocol documents which contracts are upgradeable, how upgrades work, and what governance process controls upgrades. Users need to understand if contract logic can change after deployment.

Where to Look: Look for "Upgrades", "Proxy", "Governance", or "Contract Management" sections. Check for explanations of upgrade mechanisms and processes.

Scoring Criteria: Simplified evaluation of upgradeability documentation:

    100% (Full marks): Upgradeability is documented anywhere in the documentation, whether with full details or missing some process information. Any mention of contract upgrades, proxy patterns, or immutability qualifies.

    40%: Basic mention of upgradeability without comprehensive details - perhaps just stating contracts are upgradeable without explaining the process.

    0%: No documentation about contract upgradeability whatsoever.

Answer Format: The answer should state whether upgradeability is documented and provide the resulting score. For example:

    "Yes – the documentation describes the upgrade mechanism for contracts. Score: 100%."

If minimal information:

    "Upgradeability is briefly mentioned but lacks process details. Score: 40%."

If no information:

    "No – the documentation does not mention contract upgradeability. Score: 0%."

Each statement should be backed by a citation from the documentation where the information (or lack thereof) was confirmed.
