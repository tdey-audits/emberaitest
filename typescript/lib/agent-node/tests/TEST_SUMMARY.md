## Test Organization

### Naming Convention

- **Unit tests**: `*.unit.test.ts` - Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration tests**: `*.int.test.ts` - Test component interactions
- **Live tests**: `*.live.test.ts` - Test against real services (not created yet)

### Test Structure

All tests follow the Given-When-Then pattern:

- **Given**: Setup and context
- **When**: Action being tested
- **Then**: Expected outcomes

### Key Testing Patterns Used

1. **Behavior Testing**: Tests focus on WHAT the system does, not HOW
2. **Isolation**: Each test is independent and doesn't affect others
3. **Clear Failure Messages**: Tests fail with descriptive messages
4. **Mock Usage**:
   - Unit tests use `vi.mock()` for dependencies
   - Integration tests use MSW for HTTP boundaries

## Expected Production Files

Based on the tests, the following implementation files will be needed:

### Core Server

- `src/a2a/server.ts` - Main server setup
- `src/a2a/jsonrpc/handlers.ts` - JSON-RPC method handlers

### Managers

- `src/tasks/manager.ts` - Task lifecycle management
- `src/sessions/manager.ts` - Session management
- `src/workflows/runtime.ts` - Workflow execution engine

### Infrastructure

- `src/streaming/sse.ts` - Server-sent events implementation
- `src/wallet/embedded.ts` - Embedded EOA wallet
- `src/integrations/mcp-client.ts` - MCP client for Onchain Actions

### Type Definitions

- `src/tasks/types.ts` - Task-related types
- `src/sessions/types.ts` - Session types
- `src/workflows/types.ts` - Workflow plugin types

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Start with Core Components**:
   - Implement `src/a2a/server.ts` to make server tests pass
   - Add JSON-RPC handlers to support basic methods

2. **Add State Management**:
   - Implement task manager for lifecycle tracking
   - Add session manager for context isolation

3. **Build Workflow System**:
   - Create workflow runtime with plugin support
   - Implement pause/resume mechanics

4. **Add Streaming**:
   - Implement SSE for real-time updates
   - Connect to task and workflow events

5. **Integrate External Services**:
   - Add wallet functionality
   - Connect MCP client for GMX operations

## Test Execution

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Run Specific Test Types

```bash
npm run test:unit    # Unit tests only
npm run test:int     # Integration tests only
npm run test:live    # Live tests (when available)
```

### Watch Mode for Development

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Notes

- All tests are currently failing with module not found errors, which is expected in TDD
- Integration tests that require server startup are skipped until implementation exists
- Tests are designed to drive the implementation design
- Each test file can run independently once implementation is in place
