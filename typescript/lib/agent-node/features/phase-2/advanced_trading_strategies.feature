Feature: Advanced Trading Strategies (Phase 2)
  As a trader
  In order to execute sophisticated trading strategies beyond basic long/short positions
  I want advanced order types, portfolio management, and automated trading strategies

  Background:
    Given Phase 1 (Stages 1.1-1.4) is successfully completed
    And the delta-neutral agent foundation is operational
    And advanced trading capabilities are being introduced in Phase 2

  @core @future
  Scenario: Advanced order types beyond market and limit
    Given the agent has basic market and limit order support from Phase 1
    When Phase 2 advanced order types are implemented
    Then the agent should support additional order types such as:
      | Order Type | Description |
      | Stop Loss | Automated position closure on adverse price movement |
      | Take Profit | Automated position closure on favorable price movement |
      | Trailing Stop | Dynamic stop loss that follows favorable price movement |
      | Bracket Orders | Combined entry with stop loss and take profit |
    And advanced orders should integrate with existing GMX capabilities

  @core @future
  Scenario: Multi-asset portfolio management
    Given the agent currently supports single-asset position management
    When multi-asset portfolio features are implemented
    Then the agent should manage portfolios across multiple assets
    And portfolio rebalancing should be automated
    And risk management should consider portfolio-wide exposure
    And correlation analysis should inform trading decisions

  @core @future
  Scenario: Automated delta-neutral strategy execution
    Given the agent has basic position management capabilities
    When automated delta-neutral strategies are implemented
    Then the agent should automatically maintain delta-neutral positions
    And hedging should be dynamically adjusted based on market conditions
    And strategy performance should be monitored and optimized
    And risk parameters should be configurable and enforced

  @core @future
  Scenario: Advanced market analysis and signals
    Given the agent has basic market data integration
    When advanced analysis capabilities are implemented
    Then the agent should provide technical analysis indicators
    And market sentiment analysis should inform trading decisions
    And predictive models should enhance strategy performance
    And signal quality should be continuously evaluated

  @integration @future
  Scenario: Advanced strategies integrate with Phase 1 foundation
    Given Phase 1 provides A2A interface, MCP capabilities, and MMDT wallet
    When Phase 2 advanced strategies are implemented
    Then all Phase 1 interfaces should support advanced trading features
    And delegation caveats should work with complex trading strategies
    And error handling and observability should extend to advanced features
    And the agent should maintain backward compatibility with Phase 1 clients

  # Note: This is a placeholder feature for Phase 2 implementation
  # Detailed scenarios will be developed when Phase 2 planning begins
