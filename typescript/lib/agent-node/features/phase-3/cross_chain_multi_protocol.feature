Feature: Cross-Chain and Multi-Protocol Support (Phase 3)
  As a trader
  In order to access trading opportunities across different blockchain networks and protocols
  I want cross-chain trading capabilities and multi-protocol support

  Background:
    Given Phase 1 (Delta-Neutral Agent Foundation) is completed
    And Phase 2 (Advanced Trading Strategies) is operational
    And cross-chain infrastructure is being introduced in Phase 3

  @core @future
  Scenario: Multi-chain trading support
    Given the agent currently operates on Arbitrum One only
    When multi-chain support is implemented in Phase 3
    Then the agent should support trading across multiple chains:
      | Chain | Protocols |
      | Ethereum Mainnet | Native DEXs, DeFi protocols |
      | Arbitrum One | GMX, Uniswap, other Layer 2 protocols |
      | Optimism | Perpetual protocols, AMMs |
      | Polygon | Various DeFi protocols |
      | Base | Emerging DeFi ecosystem |
    And cross-chain position management should be unified

  @core @future
  Scenario: Cross-chain liquidity aggregation
    Given different chains have varying liquidity depths
    When cross-chain liquidity aggregation is implemented
    Then the agent should find optimal execution across chains
    And bridge costs should be factored into execution decisions
    And liquidity fragmentation should be minimized for users
    And execution should consider gas costs across different chains

  @core @future
  Scenario: Multi-protocol perpetuals integration
    Given the agent currently integrates with GMX only
    When multi-protocol support is added
    Then the agent should support multiple perpetuals protocols:
      | Protocol | Chain | Features |
      | GMX | Arbitrum | Current integration |
      | Perpetual Protocol | Optimism | Alternative perps |
      | dYdX | StarkEx/Ethereum | Advanced trading |
      | Gains Network | Polygon | Leverage trading |
    And protocol selection should be optimized per trade

  @core @future
  Scenario: Cross-chain bridge integration
    Given positions may need to be managed across chains
    When cross-chain bridges are integrated
    Then the agent should support major bridge protocols
    And bridge security and reliability should be evaluated
    And bridging costs should be optimized
    And bridge transaction monitoring should be implemented

  @core @future
  Scenario: Unified cross-chain wallet management
    Given MMDT wallet from Phase 1 operates on single chain
    When cross-chain capabilities are added
    Then wallet operations should work across supported chains
    And delegation caveats should apply cross-chain
    And gas management should handle multiple native tokens
    And cross-chain transaction coordination should be secure

  @integration @future
  Scenario: Cross-chain features integrate with existing architecture
    Given Phase 1 and Phase 2 provide foundation and advanced strategies
    When cross-chain capabilities are added
    Then all existing interfaces (A2A, MCP) should support multi-chain operations
    And error handling should work across chain-specific failures
    And observability should track cross-chain operations
    And session management should handle multi-chain contexts

  @integration @future
  Scenario: Cross-chain risk management
    Given trading spans multiple chains and protocols
    When cross-chain risk management is implemented
    Then portfolio risk should be calculated across all chains
    And correlation risks between chains should be considered
    And bridge risks should be factored into position management
    And emergency procedures should work across chains

  # Note: This is a placeholder feature for Phase 3 implementation
  # Detailed scenarios will be developed when Phase 3 planning begins
