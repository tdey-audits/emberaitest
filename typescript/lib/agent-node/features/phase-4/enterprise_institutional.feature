Feature: Enterprise and Institutional Features (Phase 4)
  As an institutional user or enterprise client
  In order to use the delta-neutral agent for large-scale operations
  I want enterprise-grade features, compliance tools, and institutional integrations

  Background:
    Given Phase 1 (Foundation), Phase 2 (Advanced Strategies), and Phase 3 (Cross-Chain) are completed
    And the agent has proven capabilities for individual and sophisticated traders
    And enterprise and institutional features are being introduced in Phase 4

  @core @future
  Scenario: Multi-tenant architecture for enterprise deployment
    Given the agent currently serves individual users
    When enterprise multi-tenancy is implemented
    Then the agent should support multiple isolated tenants
    And tenant data should be completely separated
    And tenant-specific configurations should be supported
    And resource allocation should be managed per tenant
    And billing and usage tracking should be tenant-aware

  @core @future
  Scenario: Institutional-grade compliance and reporting
    Given compliance requirements vary by jurisdiction and institution
    When compliance features are implemented
    Then the agent should generate regulatory reports:
      | Report Type | Compliance Standard |
      | Trade Reporting | MiFID II, EMIR |
      | Risk Reports | Basel III, Solvency II |
      | AML Reports | Anti-Money Laundering |
      | Position Reports | CFTC, SEC requirements |
    And audit trails should be comprehensive and immutable

  @core @future
  Scenario: Enterprise authentication and authorization
    Given institutional users require sophisticated access controls
    When enterprise auth is implemented
    Then the agent should support:
      | Auth Method | Use Case |
      | SSO Integration | Corporate directory integration |
      | Role-Based Access | Granular permission management |
      | API Keys | Programmatic access control |
      | Multi-Factor Auth | Enhanced security |
    And delegation should integrate with enterprise auth systems

  @core @future
  Scenario: Institutional liquidity and prime brokerage integration
    Given institutional users need access to deep liquidity
    When prime brokerage integration is implemented
    Then the agent should connect to institutional liquidity providers
    And prime brokerage relationships should be managed
    And institutional pricing should be available
    And settlement and clearing should meet institutional standards

  @core @future
  Scenario: Enterprise monitoring and alerting
    Given institutional operations require comprehensive monitoring
    When enterprise observability is implemented
    Then the agent should provide:
      | Monitoring Feature | Institutional Need |
      | Real-time Dashboards | Operations oversight |
      | Custom Alerts | Risk management |
      | Performance Analytics | Strategy optimization |
      | Capacity Planning | Infrastructure scaling |
    And monitoring should integrate with enterprise systems

  @core @future
  Scenario: High-availability and disaster recovery
    Given institutional users require maximum uptime
    When enterprise reliability features are implemented
    Then the agent should support:
      | Reliability Feature | Capability |
      | High Availability | Multi-region deployment |
      | Disaster Recovery | Automated failover |
      | Backup Systems | Data protection |
      | Load Balancing | Performance scaling |
    And SLA guarantees should be provided

  @integration @future
  Scenario: Enterprise features integrate with all previous phases
    Given Phases 1-3 provide complete trading platform functionality
    When enterprise features are added
    Then all existing capabilities should scale to enterprise levels
    And institutional workflows should leverage advanced strategies
    And cross-chain operations should support institutional volumes
    And the foundational architecture should support enterprise demands

  @integration @future
  Scenario: Institutional risk management and compliance
    Given institutional users have complex risk and compliance needs
    When integrated with all trading capabilities
    Then risk management should work across all supported chains and protocols
    And compliance should be enforced for all trading strategies
    And reporting should cover all agent activities across all phases
    And audit capabilities should meet institutional standards

  # Note: This is a placeholder feature for Phase 4 implementation
  # Detailed scenarios will be developed when Phase 4 planning begins
