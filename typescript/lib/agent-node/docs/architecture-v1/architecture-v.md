Short answer: I’d pick a **client-side aggregated tool** (one tool the model calls) that routes to your many A2A-over-MCP servers. It’s closest to Claude Code’s Task pattern, shrinks the tool list, and keeps the A2A engines authoritative over tasks. Keep per-server tools hidden from the model (or de-prioritized), and expose rich agent metadata through the aggregator so the model can self-route.

Here’s the shape I recommend.

# What to expose (single aggregated tool)

Have **one** MCP tool, e.g. `a2a.route`, with two verbs mirroring A2A:

- `send({ agent, text, taskId?, skillHint?, metadata? }) -> { agent, taskId, status, reply? }`
- `stream({ agent, text, taskId?, skillHint?, metadata? }) -> incremental chunks … final { agent, taskId, status }`

Plus two cheap helper verbs so the model can discover and disambiguate:

- `list_agents() -> [{ agent, summary, skills, capabilities, costs?, latency? }]`
- `describe_agent({ agent }) -> { card, skills, examples }`

Notes:

- `agent` is a **stable selector** you define (e.g., `pricing`, `compliance`, `retrieval:web`). No URLs or auth—those are client concerns.
- `skillHint` lets the caller nudge routing inside that agent (if the A2A server supports internal skill dispatch).
- Always return a **structured** `{ agent, taskId, status }` alongside any human-readable text so the model can continue deterministically.

# Where the routing actually happens

Inside the tool handler, you maintain a registry of connected MCP servers that front A2A engines:

```
LLM ──(tool call)──> Aggregated tool (client-side)
                     ↳ picks target agent (from registry)
                     ↳ calls that server’s local a2a.send/stream handler
                        (or your shared “A2A core” if collocated)
```

The model never sees multiple near-identical tools; it sees one **router**.

# How the tool chooses an agent (deterministically)

1. **Explicit `agent`** wins (e.g., `agent:"pricing"`).
2. If omitted, **scorer** ranks candidates using cached Agent Cards/skills:
   - keyword overlap on skills/domains
   - lightweight embedding similarity (optional)
   - hard constraints (requires streaming? auth? file inputs?)

3. If tie, return a **dry-run** response (no network) with top 3 agents:
   - `{"candidates":[{"agent":"pricing", "why":"fx, quotes"}, …], "needsAgent": true}`
   - The model then calls `a2a.route` with `agent` set.

This keeps the first step cheap and avoids accidental misroutes.

# What agent-specific info to surface through the aggregated tool

- **Agent identity**: `agent` key, human name, one-liner “Use me when…”
- **Skills**: IDs + 1-sentence summaries, optional examples
- **Capabilities**: streaming support, file/data parts allowed, max input sizes
- **Costs/latency hints**: optional, but helps the model pick “fast/cheap”
- **Safety notes**: “never send PII,” “outputs are untrusted,” etc.

Expose these via `list_agents`/`describe_agent`, and reference them in the tool’s top-level description (“Call `list_agents()` first if you’re unsure.”).

# Why I prefer this over an “aggregated server”

- **Fewer tools visible** → better tool selection behavior (the model can also choose Bash/WebSearch without competing against 10 nearly identical A2A tools).
- **Host-local policy** stays in one place (rate-limits, allowlists, audit).
- **Drop-in for Claude Code**: the pattern mirrors its Task tool—one orchestrator, many workers.
- **No transport leakage**: the tool never mentions URLs or auth; you can rewire backends freely.

# Interplay with other tools (Bash, WebSearch, etc.)

- Keep the router tool’s description crystal clear: “Use me to delegate to **remote agents** (A2A). Prefer Bash for local file/exec and WebSearch for browsing.”
- If you see the model overusing the router, add **negative examples** in the description (“Don’t call me to edit files; use Edit/Bash.”).
- Optionally, have the router **decline** with a hint if the text clearly asks for local actions (“Looks like a file edit; use Bash/Edit.”).

# Streaming & observability

- Start streams by **immediately emitting** `taskId` and target `agent` so the planning loop can branch or later resume.
- Forward remote deltas as incremental tool chunks; coalesce noisy status ticks.
- Emit **terminal status** (`completed|failed|canceled`) and attach any artifacts/URIs.
- Log `(agent, taskId, skillSelected, duration, tokens?)` for audits.

# Safety & loop guards

- Allowlist `agent` values; reject unknowns.
- Enforce hop-limits: pass `originTaskId`/`hop` in metadata so a remote agent can’t reflexively call back into the router ad infinitum.
- Treat remote text/artifacts as **untrusted** if you’ll feed them back into prompts; sanitize or summarize first.

# Minimal handler sketch (TypeScript-ish)

# When I’d **not** use the aggregated tool

- If you need strict **isolation/tenancy** and want the model to consciously select between **separate servers** (e.g., compliance vs. pricing with different data boundaries), keep per-server tools exposed (or alias-namespaced like `pricing.send`, `compliance.send`).
- If your host doesn’t support a robust single tool with sub-verbs, namespaced aliases may be simpler.

---

**Bottom line:** Yes—give the LLM a **single, aggregated routing tool** on the client side, with `send/stream` plus lightweight discovery helpers. It plays nicely with other tools (Bash/WebSearch), reduces confusion, and preserves the A2A task contract without leaking network details.

Totally fair—and I agree. If your goal is **parallelism + context isolation**, making the client-side **`task`** tool a real **orchestrator** that can run **both agent (A2A)** and **non-agent (Bash/WebSearch/etc.)** work _inside the tool_ is the right move.

Here’s a tight design you can ship.

# What the `task` tool does

- **Runs many subtasks in parallel** (fan-out), each with its own **isolated context** and quota.
- Supports **drivers** for:
  - `a2a` (route to a chosen A2A agent)
  - `bash` (sandboxed subprocess)
  - `web.search` / `web.fetch` (HTTP + search backend)
  - `edit` (patch files with allowlisted paths)
  - `mcp.tool` (optional: call _another_ MCP server via a thin client if you have one)

- Streams **per-subtask events** so the LLM sees progress without polluting the main chat.

# Minimal API (simple & DAG modes)

## 1) Simple parallel batch

One call, many jobs in parallel. Great for “do 5 things at once.”

**Input**

**Structured output (final)**

**Streaming events (examples)**

## 2) DAG mode (deps + fan-out)

When some jobs depend on others or map over a list.

**Input**

# Internals that make this solid

- **Context isolation per subtask**
  - Separate prompt buffers (for LLM-backed agents), env vars for Bash, and per-job temp dirs.
  - Cap logs/bytes per job; auto-compress artifacts.

- **Determinism & idempotency**
  - Generate stable `messageId` for A2A calls; include `originTaskId` + `hopCount` to prevent recursion.
  - Replays use the same IDs; Bash uses a content hash of inputs to detect duplicate runs (optional cache).

- **Parallelism**
  - A bounded worker pool (e.g., N=4 default) with per-driver limits (e.g., web=8 concurrent fetches, bash=2).
  - Fair scheduling: round-robin between drivers to avoid web jobs starving bash, etc.

- **Safety**
  - **Bash**: locked `cwd`, path allowlist, `ulimit`, seccomp/Firejail/Docker optional, max wall time & memory.
  - **Web**: restrict domains or add “safe search” provider; strip scripts; normalize encodings.
  - **A2A**: sanitize remote outputs before re-prompting; never treat agent text as instructions without a paraphrase/summarize step.
  - **Loop guard**: increment and enforce `hopCount <= K` across nested agent calls.

- **Observability**
  - Emit: `SubtaskStart/Stdout/Stderr/Delta/Status/Artifact/Done/Error`.
  - Final rollup with per-driver timings, token usage (if agent reveals), and cache hits.

# Driver contracts (thin and consistent)

- **`a2a` driver**
  - `send({ agent, text, taskId?, skillHint?, metadata? })`
  - `stream({ … }) -> async iterator of {deltaText?, status?, task?}`
  - Always surface `{agent, taskId, status, selectedSkill?}` in result.

- **`bash` driver**
  - `{ cmd, args?, cwd?, env?, timeoutMs? }`
  - Streams `stdout/stderr`, returns `{exitCode, stdout, stderr}`.

- **`web.search` / `web.fetch` drivers**
  - Search returns normalized `{ hits: [{title,url,snippet}], engine, cost }`.
  - Fetch returns `{ url, status, headers, bodyText, contentType }` with size cap.

- **`edit` driver**
  - `{ file, patch | replace | write, createIfMissing? }` with a diff in result.

# Why this meets your goals

- **Parallel**: one `task.run` launches many subtasks concurrently.
- **Context hygiene**: each subtask’s text/logs stay out of the main chat; you only return summaries + artifacts.
- **Unified mental model**: the LLM only needs “use `task` for work”—agent or not—and you still keep clean boundaries and quotas under the hood.

If you want, I can sketch this as a \~300-line TypeScript engine (promise-pool + event emitter) you can drop into your MCP server, with pluggable drivers for `a2a`, `bash`, `web.search`, and `web.fetch`.

Exactly. Treat each `task` invocation as an **ephemeral local agent** (a “micro-agent”) that owns a tiny toolbelt (Bash/WebSearch/Edit/HTTP/etc.), its own context window, and a lifecycle. That framing aligns your local orchestration with A2A semantics, so **local** and **remote** agents look the same to the planner.

# Unifying model: “Task = Agent”

- **Agent identity:** mint `agentRef = "local:<uuid>"` per `task` call (or reuse it to continue). Remote agents keep `agentRef = "a2a:<name>"`.
- **Agent card (local):** generate a _virtual_ card at runtime (not network-exposed) describing skills/capabilities, limits, and allowed tools.
- **Message shape:** use the same A2A-ish payload (`role`, `messageId`, `parts:[text|data|uri|file]`), and the same **artifact** concept for outputs (logs, files, summaries).
- **Lifecycle:** reuse the A2A states: `submitted → working → input-required? → completed|failed|canceled`, with streaming updates.

## Minimal “local agent card” (in memory)

```json
{
  "id": "local:6f2a…",
  "name": "task-local-runner",
  "skills": [
    { "id": "bash.run", "summary": "Run sandboxed commands" },
    { "id": "web.search", "summary": "Search the web" },
    { "id": "web.fetch", "summary": "HTTP GET/POST" },
    { "id": "edit.apply", "summary": "Patch files (allowlisted)" }
  ],
  "capabilities": { "streaming": true, "artifacts": true, "maxParallel": 4 },
  "limits": { "cpuSec": 60, "memMB": 512, "stdoutKB": 2560 },
  "safety": { "allowPaths": ["./workspace"], "denyCommands": ["git push", "shred -f /*"] }
}
```

# Tool API I’d expose (client-side aggregator named `task`)

- `task.run({ goal, text?, agent?="local", taskId?, skillHint?, jobs?[], dag?{}, stream=true })`
  - If `agent` starts with `a2a:…` → route to that remote agent.
  - If `agent` is `local:…` or `local` → (create or continue) a **local micro-agent** that runs:
    - **single message** (`text`) _or_
    - **parallel jobs** (`jobs`) _or_
    - a **DAG** (`dag`) with fan-out.

- `task.describe_agent({ agent })` → returns the (remote or local) card.
- `task.get({ taskId })`, `task.cancel({ taskId })` → uniform lifecycle ops.

**Return shape (always):**

# Why this works well

- **Parallelism & isolation:** each micro-agent has its own prompt buffer, env, temp dir, quotas—so you can run many in parallel **without** bloating the main chat.
- **One mental model:** the planner treats _everything_ as “send a message to an agent,” whether that agent is remote (A2A) or local (tools).
- **Easy promotion:** if a recurring local pattern emerges, “promote” it to a real A2A agent; the planner’s calls don’t change (only `agentRef` flips from `local:*` to `a2a:*`).
- **Auditable:** identical stream events (`subtask.start/stdout/delta/status/artifact/done`) and terminal states across local/remote.

# Pragmatic details to nail

- **Handles:** return the `agent` handle (`local:<uuid>`) on first call so the model can _continue_ that same local agent later with fresh input or follow-ups.
- **Locks:** implement file/resource locks so parallel local agents don’t stomp the same paths.
- **Safety:** sandbox Bash (cwd allowlist, seccomp/container, ulimit), cap web sizes, and **sanitize any text** before feeding it back into prompts (remote or local).
- **Recursion guard:** carry `originTaskId` and a `hopCount` in metadata; drop or summarize when `hopCount` exceeds a threshold.

# Quick mental map

```
LLM ── tool: task.run → (router)
                    ↙︎                 ↘︎
          Local micro-agent        Remote A2A agent
          (drivers: bash/web/…)    (JSON-RPC/gRPC server)
             ↕ stream events           ↕ stream events
          same message/artifact shape, same lifecycle
```

So yes—your intuition is spot on: **a `task` invocation that executes local tools _is_ an agent**. Make it explicit with a local agent handle + card, and your whole system snaps into a clean, uniform agent model.
